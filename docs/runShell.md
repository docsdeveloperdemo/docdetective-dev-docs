## What does this do?

The `runShell` function executes a shell command and returns the result.

## Why should I use this?

The `runShell` function can be used to execute any shell command from within a Node.js script. This can be useful for automating tasks that would otherwise require manual intervention, such as running a build script or deploying an application.

## Prerequisites

To use the `runShell` function, you must have the following:

* A Node.js environment
* The `spawnCommand` function from the `child_process` module

## How to use this

To use the `runShell` function, simply pass the command you want to execute as the first argument, and an array of arguments as the second argument. The function will return a promise that resolves to an object containing the following properties:

* `status`: The status of the command (either "PASS" or "FAIL")
* `description`: A description of the command's output
* `exitCode`: The exit code of the command
* `stdout`: The standard output of the command
* `stderr`: The standard error of the command

Here is an example of how to use the `runShell` function:

```javascript
const { runShell } = require('doc-detective-core');

async function main() {
  const result = await runShell('ls', ['-l']);

  console.log(result);
}

main();
```

This example will execute the `ls` command with the `-l` argument, and will print the output of the command to the console.

## Additional notes

The `runShell` function can be used to execute any shell command, but it is important to note that the function does not provide any security or error handling. If you are executing a command that could potentially be dangerous, you should take appropriate precautions to protect your system.

Additionally, the `runShell` function does not support piping or redirection of output. If you need to pipe or redirect output, you can use the `child_process` module directly.
