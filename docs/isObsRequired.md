## What does this do?

The `isObsRequired` function checks if a set of test specifications require OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) to be used for recording. It iterates through the specifications, tests, and steps to determine if any of the steps include the "startRecording" action. If this action is found, it indicates that OBS is required for recording the tests.

## Why should I use this?

The `isObsRequired` function is useful for determining whether OBS is necessary for running a set of tests. This can help in setting up the appropriate recording environment and ensuring that the tests can be successfully executed.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `isObsRequired` function, you should have a basic understanding of the following:

- **Test specifications**: A set of instructions that define the tests to be executed.
- **Tests**: Individual test cases within a test specification.
- **Steps**: The actions that are performed during a test.

## How to use this

To use the `isObsRequired` function, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the `isObsRequired` function into your code.
2. Call the `isObsRequired` function with the test specifications as the input.
3. The function will return a boolean value indicating whether OBS is required for recording the tests.

Here is an example of how you can use the `isObsRequired` function:

```javascript
import { isObsRequired } from 'doc-detective-core';

const specs = [
  {
    tests: [
      {
        steps: [
          {
            action: 'startRecording',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
];

const obsRequired = isObsRequired(specs);

if (obsRequired) {
  // OBS is required for recording the tests.
} else {
  // OBS is not required for recording the tests.
}
```

## Additional notes

- The `isObsRequired` function currently only checks for the "startRecording" action. If you are using other recording options, you may need to enhance the check based on your specific recording conditions.
- The `isObsRequired` function does not actually start or stop OBS. It only determines whether OBS is required for recording the tests.
