## What does this do?

The `setFiles` function is used to set the files that will be used for testing. It takes a configuration object as an argument, which contains information about the test setup, input, and cleanup.

## Why should I use this?

The `setFiles` function is useful for organizing and managing the files that will be used for testing. It allows you to specify the files that you want to test, and it can also be used to exclude files that you do not want to test.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `setFiles` function, you must first create a configuration object. This object should contain the following properties:

* `runTests.setup`: An array of files that will be executed before the tests are run.
* `runTests.input`: An array of files that will be used as input for the tests.
* `runTests.cleanup`: An array of files that will be executed after the tests are run.

## How to use this

To use the `setFiles` function, simply call it with the configuration object as an argument. The function will then return an array of files that will be used for testing.

Here is an example of how to use the `setFiles` function:

```javascript
const config = {
  runTests: {
    setup: ['setup.js'],
    input: ['input.js'],
    cleanup: ['cleanup.js'],
  },
};

const files = setFiles(config);

console.log(files);
```

The output of the above code will be an array of files that will be used for testing.

## Additional notes

* The `setFiles` function can also be used to set the directories that will be used for testing. To do this, simply specify the directories in the `runTests.input` property of the configuration object.
* The `setFiles` function will automatically exclude any files that are located in the `node_modules` directory.
* The `setFiles` function can be used to set the files that will be used for both unit tests and integration tests.
