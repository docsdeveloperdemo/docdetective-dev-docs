## What does this do?

The `getSuggestions` function generates a list of suggested tests based on the markup coverage of a set of files. It identifies uncovered matches in the markup and prompts the user to specify the intent of each match. Based on the user's input, it constructs appropriate test actions and organizes them into a test specification.

## Why should I use this?

The `getSuggestions` function is useful for generating initial test suites for a codebase. It helps identify areas of the code that lack test coverage and provides a starting point for writing comprehensive tests.

## Prerequisites

To use the `getSuggestions` function, you will need:

- A configuration object that specifies the project-specific settings for generating tests.
- A markup coverage object that contains information about the coverage of markup elements in the codebase.

## How to use this

To use the `getSuggestions` function, follow these steps:

1. Import the `getSuggestions` function from the `doc-detective-core` module.
2. Call the `getSuggestions` function with the configuration object and markup coverage object as arguments.
3. The function will return a test specification object that contains a list of suggested tests.
4. You can then use the test specification object to generate test code or integrate it into your existing test framework.

## Example

The following code shows an example of how to use the `getSuggestions` function:

```javascript
import { getSuggestions } from 'doc-detective-core';

const config = {
  // Project-specific settings
};

const markupCoverage = {
  // Coverage information for the codebase
};

const spec = getSuggestions(config, markupCoverage);

console.log(spec);
```

The output of the `getSuggestions` function will be a test specification object that contains a list of suggested tests. Each test will have an ID, a file path, and a list of actions. The actions will specify the type of test to be performed (e.g., find, click, type, etc.) and the target element or value.

You can then use the test specification object to generate test code or integrate it into your existing test framework.
