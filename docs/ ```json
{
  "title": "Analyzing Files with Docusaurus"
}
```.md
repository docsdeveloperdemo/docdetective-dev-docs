## What does this do?

The `analysis.js` file is responsible for analyzing files and extracting relevant information for documentation generation. It supports various file types, including JavaScript, TypeScript, and Markdown.

## Why should I use this?

Using the `analysis.js` file allows you to easily generate documentation for your codebase without manually writing markdown files. It extracts information such as function signatures, descriptions, and usage examples, making it easier to understand and use your code.

## Prerequisites

To use the `analysis.js` file, you will need to have the following:

- Node.js installed
- The `doc-detective-core` package installed

## How to use this

To use the `analysis.js` file, follow these steps:

1. Import the `analysis.js` file into your project.
2. Create a configuration file that specifies the file types and extensions to be analyzed.
3. Run the `analysis.js` file with the configuration file as an argument.
4. The `analysis.js` file will generate markdown files for each file type, containing the extracted information.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the `analysis.js` file:

```
// Import the analysis.js file
const analysis = require('doc-detective-core/analysis');

// Create a configuration file
const config = {
  fileTypes: [
    {
      extensions: ['js', 'ts'],
      parser: 'typescript',
    },
    {
      extensions: ['md'],
      parser: 'markdown',
    },
  ],
};

// Run the analysis.js file
analysis(config);

// The analysis.js file will generate markdown files for each file type, containing the extracted information.
```
