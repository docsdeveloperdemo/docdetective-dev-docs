## What does this do?

The `fileType` constant is used to find the file type that matches the given file extension. This is done by iterating over the list of file types and checking if the extension is included in the list of extensions for each file type.

## Why should I use this?

The `fileType` constant is useful for determining the type of file that is being processed. This information can be used to perform different operations on the file, such as opening it in the correct application or converting it to a different format.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using the `fileType` constant.

## How to use this

To use the `fileType` constant, you can simply import it from the `doc-detective-core` module. Once you have imported the constant, you can use it to find the file type for a given file extension. For example, the following code shows how to find the file type for the file `myfile.txt`:

```javascript
const fileType = config.fileTypes.find((fileType) => fileType.extensions.includes('txt'));
```

The `fileType` constant will be assigned the value of the first file type that matches the extension `txt`. In this case, the `fileType` constant will be assigned the value of the `TextFile` file type.

## Relevant method or class

The `fileType` constant is used in the following method:

* `getFileType(extension)`: This method returns the file type that matches the given file extension.

## Example

The following code shows how to use the `fileType` constant to find the file type for a given file extension:

```javascript
const fileType = config.fileTypes.find((fileType) => fileType.extensions.includes('txt'));

console.log(fileType.name); // TextFile
```

The output of the above code will be `TextFile`.
