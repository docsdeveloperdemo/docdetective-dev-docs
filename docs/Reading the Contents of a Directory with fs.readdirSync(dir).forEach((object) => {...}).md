The `fs.readdirSync(dir).forEach((object) => {...})` function reads the contents of a directory and performs a specified action on each file or directory within that directory. In this case, the action is to check if the file or directory is a valid source file and add it to an array of files or directories.

## Why should I use this?

This function can be used to read the contents of a directory and perform a specific action on each file or directory within that directory. This can be useful for tasks such as finding all of the files in a directory that match a certain pattern or copying all of the files in a directory to another location.

## Prerequisites

To use this function, you will need to have the `fs` module installed. You can install the `fs` module by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install fs
```

## How to use this

To use this function, you will need to provide the path to the directory that you want to read the contents of. You can then specify the action that you want to perform on each file or directory within that directory.

For example, the following code uses the `fs.readdirSync(dir).forEach((object) => {...})` function to read the contents of the `./src` directory and add all of the files in that directory to an array:

```
const fs = require('fs');

const files = [];

fs.readdirSync('./src').forEach((object) => {
  const content = path.resolve('./src/' + object);

  // Exclude node_modules
  if (content.includes('node_modules')) return;

  // Check if file or directory
  const isFile = fs.statSync(content).isFile();

  // Add to files array
  if (isFile) {
    files.push(path.resolve(content));
  }
});
```

## Relevant method or class

The `fs.readdirSync(dir).forEach((object) => {...})` function is a method of the `fs` module. The `fs` module provides a number of functions for interacting with the file system.

## Writing style

The writing style of the documentation should be similar to the writing style of the existing documentation. However, it is important to make sure that the documentation is accurate and up-to-date.

## Placeholders

The following placeholders are used in the documentation:

* Reading the Contents of a Directory with fs.readdirSync(dir).forEach((object) => {...}): This placeholder should be replaced with the title of the document.
* **{{Method or Class Name}}**: This placeholder should be replaced with the name of the method or class that is being documented.
* **{{Description}}**: This placeholder should be replaced with a description of the method or class.
* **{{Usage}}**: This placeholder should be replaced with instructions on how to use the method or class.
* **{{Example}}**: This placeholder should be replaced with an example of how to use the method or class.

## Important rule

The most important rule is to make sure that the documentation is accurate and up-to-date. This means that the documentation should reflect the current code and context.
