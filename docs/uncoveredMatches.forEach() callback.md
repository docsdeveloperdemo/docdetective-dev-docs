## What does this do?

The `suggest` method suggests a list of possible matches for a given query. It takes a query string and a list of possible matches as input, and returns a list of matches that are most relevant to the query.

## Why should I use this?

The `suggest` method can be used to improve the user experience by providing a list of possible matches for a given query. This can help users to find the information they are looking for more quickly and easily.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using the `suggest` method.

## How to use this

To use the `suggest` method, you must first create a list of possible matches. This list can be created by using the `getMatches` method. Once you have created a list of possible matches, you can use the `suggest` method to suggest a list of matches for a given query.

The following code sample shows you how to use the `suggest` method:

```
const matches = getMatches();
const suggestedMatches = suggest(query, matches);
```

The `suggest` method returns a list of matches that are most relevant to the query. The matches are sorted by relevance, with the most relevant matches appearing first.

## Example

The following example shows you how to use the `suggest` method to suggest a list of possible matches for a given query.

```
const matches = [
  {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
    phone: "0123456789"
  },
  {
    name: "Jane Doe",
    email: "jane.doe@example.com",
    phone: "0987654321"
  },
  {
    name: "John Smith",
    email: "john.smith@example.com",
    phone: "0123456789"
  }
];

const query = "John";

const suggestedMatches = suggest(query, matches);

console.log(suggestedMatches);
```

The output of the above code sample is:

```
[
  {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
    phone: "0123456789"
  },
  {
    name: "John Smith",
    email: "john.smith@example.com",
    phone: "0123456789"
  }
]
```
