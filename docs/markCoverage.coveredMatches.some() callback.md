## What does this do?

The `object` parameter is compared to the `matchObject` parameter to determine if they are equivalent. The comparison is based on the following criteria:

- The line numbers of the objects must be the same.
- The text of the objects must be the same.
- The index of the objects in the file must be the same.

If all of these criteria are met, then the objects are considered to be equivalent.

## Why should I use this?

This function can be used to compare two objects to see if they are equivalent. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as:

- Testing: This function can be used to test whether two objects are equal. This can be helpful for debugging purposes.
- Data validation: This function can be used to validate data to ensure that it is consistent.
- Object comparison: This function can be used to compare two objects to see if they are the same. This can be helpful for a variety of purposes, such as determining whether two objects are duplicates.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using this function.

## How to use this

To use this function, simply pass two objects as arguments. The function will return a boolean value indicating whether the objects are equivalent.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```javascript
const object1 = {
  line: 1,
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  indexInFile: 0
};

const object2 = {
  line: 1,
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  indexInFile: 0
};

const areEquivalent = compareObjects(object1, object2);

console.log(areEquivalent); // true
```

## Conclusion

The `compareObjects` function is a versatile tool that can be used for a variety of purposes. It is simple to use and can be easily integrated into your code.
