## What does this do?
The `buildFind` function is used to construct an action object that can be used to find an element on a web page and perform various actions on it.

## Why should I use this?
The `buildFind` function is useful for automating tasks that require interacting with specific elements on a web page. For example, you could use it to click a button, type text into an input field, or move the mouse to a specific location.

## Prerequisites
Before using the `buildFind` function, you must have a basic understanding of JavaScript and the Puppeteer library. You should also be familiar with the concept of CSS selectors.

## How to use this
To use the `buildFind` function, you must provide it with the following parameters:

* `config`: A configuration object that contains information about the current state of the web page.
* `match`: A match object that contains information about the element to be found.
* `intent`: A string that specifies the intended action to be performed on the element.

The `buildFind` function will then return an action object that can be used to perform the specified action on the element.

## Example
The following example shows how to use the `buildFind` function to click a button on a web page:

```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://www.example.com');

  const action = buildFind(config, match, 'click');

  await page.evaluate(action);

  await browser.close();
})();
```

In this example, the `buildFind` function is used to create an action object that will click the button with the CSS selector `.btn-primary`. The `evaluate` method is then used to execute the action object on the web page.

## Conclusion
The `buildFind` function is a powerful tool that can be used to automate a wide variety of tasks on web pages. By understanding how to use this function, you can improve your productivity and efficiency when working with the Puppeteer library.
