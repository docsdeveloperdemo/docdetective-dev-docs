## What does this do?
This method iterates through the tests in the spec and checks if the id of the test matches the id of the statementJson. If there is a match, the idMatch variable is set to true.

## Why should I use this?
This method is used to check if a statement is present in the spec. This is useful for ensuring that the statement is covered by the tests.

## Prequsites
None

## How to use this
To use this method, you first need to create a spec object that contains the tests. Then, you can call the forEach() method on the spec object and pass in the test() function. The test() function will be called for each test in the spec. Inside the test() function, you can access the id of the test using the test.id property. You can also access the id of the statementJson using the statementJson.id property. If the two ids match, you can set the idMatch variable to true.

Here is an example of how to use this method:

```
const spec = {
  tests: [
    {
      id: 'test1',
      name: 'Test 1'
    },
    {
      id: 'test2',
      name: 'Test 2'
    }
  ]
};

const statementJson = {
  id: 'test1'
};

let idMatch = false;

spec.tests.forEach((test) => {
  if (test.id && test.id === statementJson.id) idMatch = true;
});

if (idMatch) {
  // The statement is present in the spec
} else {
  // The statement is not present in the spec
}
```
