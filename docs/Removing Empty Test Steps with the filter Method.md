## What does this do?

The `filter` method is used to remove any test objects from the `spec.tests` array that have an empty `steps` array. This ensures that only tests with at least one step are included in the array.

## Why should I use this?

Using this method can help to improve the efficiency of your tests by removing any tests that are not actually testing anything. This can be especially useful when you have a large number of tests and you want to reduce the amount of time it takes to run them all.

## Prerequisites

Before using this method, you must first ensure that the `spec.tests` array is an array of objects. Each object in the array should have a `steps` property that is an array of strings.

## How to use this

To use this method, simply call the `filter` method on the `spec.tests` array and pass in a callback function. The callback function should return `true` if the test object has at least one step and `false` if it does not.

Here is an example of how to use this method:

```javascript
spec.tests = spec.tests.filter((test) => test.steps.length > 0);
```

This code will remove any test objects from the `spec.tests` array that have an empty `steps` array.

## Conclusion

The `filter` method can be a useful tool for improving the efficiency of your tests. By removing any tests that are not actually testing anything, you can reduce the amount of time it takes to run your tests and improve your overall development workflow.
