## What does this do?

The `loadEnvs` function is a utility function that loads environment variables from a string or object. It can be used to load environment variables from a `.env` file, a JSON file, or a JavaScript object.

## Why should I use this?

The `loadEnvs` function can be used to simplify the process of loading environment variables. It can also be used to load environment variables from a variety of sources, which can be useful for development and testing.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using the `loadEnvs` function.

## How to use this

To use the `loadEnvs` function, simply pass a string or object containing the environment variables to the function. The function will then load the environment variables into the current process.

Here is an example of how to use the `loadEnvs` function:

```javascript
const loadEnvs = require('doc-detective-core/src/utils').loadEnvs;

// Load environment variables from a .env file
loadEnvs('.env');

// Load environment variables from a JSON file
loadEnvs('environment.json');

// Load environment variables from a JavaScript object
loadEnvs({
  PORT: 3000,
  HOST: 'localhost'
});
```

## Why and how

The `loadEnvs` function is a useful tool for loading environment variables. It can be used to simplify the process of loading environment variables, and it can also be used to load environment variables from a variety of sources.

The `loadEnvs` function works by first trying to convert the string or object passed to it into an object. If the string or object is already an object, it is simply returned. If the string or object is a string, it is parsed into an object using the `JSON.parse()` function.

Once the string or object has been converted into an object, the `loadEnvs` function iterates over the object and sets each environment variable in the current process.
