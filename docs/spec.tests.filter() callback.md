## What does this do?

The `filter` method is used to remove any test objects from the `spec.tests` array that have an empty `steps` array. This ensures that only tests with at least one step are included in the array.

## Why should I use this?

Using this method can help to improve the efficiency of your tests by removing any tests that are not actually testing anything. This can be especially useful if you have a large number of tests in your suite.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using this method.

## How to use this

To use this method, simply call the `filter` method on the `spec.tests` array and pass in a function that checks whether the `steps` array of each test object is empty. The following code shows an example of how to use this method:

```javascript
spec.tests = spec.tests.filter((test) => test.steps.length > 0);
```

This code will remove any test objects from the `spec.tests` array that have an empty `steps` array.

## Additional notes

* The `filter` method is a built-in method of the Array object. For more information, see the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter).
* The `steps` array of a test object is an array of step objects. Each step object represents a single step in the test. For more information, see the [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/api#teststeps).
