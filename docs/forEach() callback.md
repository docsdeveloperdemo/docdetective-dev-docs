## What does this do?

The `httpRequest` method is used to make an HTTP request to a specified URL. It can be used to retrieve data from a server, or to send data to a server.

## Why should I use this?

The `httpRequest` method is a convenient way to make HTTP requests from your code. It is easy to use and can be used to make a variety of different types of requests.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the `httpRequest` method, you will need to import the `httpRequest` module. You can do this by adding the following line to your code:

```
import { httpRequest } from '@doc-detective/core';
```

## How to use this

To use the `httpRequest` method, you will need to provide the following information:

* The URL of the resource you want to request
* The HTTP method you want to use (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* The body of the request (if applicable)
* The headers you want to send with the request (if applicable)

You can then use the `httpRequest` method to make the request. The method will return a promise that resolves to the response from the server.

Here is an example of how to use the `httpRequest` method to make a GET request to a server:

```
const response = await httpRequest({
  url: 'https://example.com/api/data',
  method: 'GET',
});

console.log(response.data);
```

The `response` object will contain the following properties:

* `data`: The data that was returned from the server
* `status`: The HTTP status code of the response
* `headers`: The headers that were returned from the server

## Expected Results

The expected results of using the `httpRequest` method will vary depending on the request that you make. For example, if you make a GET request to a server, you can expect to receive the data that is stored at the specified URL. If you make a POST request to a server, you can expect to receive a response that indicates whether or not the request was successful.

## Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble using the `httpRequest` method, there are a few things you can check:

* Make sure that you have imported the `httpRequest` module correctly.
* Make sure that you are providing the correct URL for the resource you want to request.
* Make sure that you are using the correct HTTP method for the request you want to make.
* Make sure that you are sending the correct body and headers with the request (if applicable).

If you are still having trouble, you can contact the developers of the `httpRequest` module for help.
