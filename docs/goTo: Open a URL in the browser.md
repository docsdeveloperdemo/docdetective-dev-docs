## What does this do?

The `goTo` method opens a URL in the browser.

## Why should I use this?

Use this method to navigate to a specific URL in the browser. This can be useful for testing web applications or automating tasks that require opening specific URLs.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `goTo` method, you must have a valid URL. The URL can be a full URL, such as `https://www.example.com`, or a relative URL, such as `/path/to/page`.

## How to use this

To use the `goTo` method, call it with the following parameters:

* `config`: A configuration object that contains the following properties:
    * `origin`: The origin of the URL. This is the part of the URL that comes before the path, such as `https://www.example.com`.
    * `url`: The URL to open. This can be a full URL or a relative URL.
* `step`: A step object that contains the following properties:
    * `origin`: The origin of the URL. This is the part of the URL that comes before the path, such as `https://www.example.com`.
    * `url`: The URL to open. This can be a full URL or a relative URL.
* `driver`: A WebDriver instance.

The `goTo` method will open the specified URL in the browser. If the URL is valid, the method will return a result object with the following properties:

* `status`: The status of the operation. This will be either `PASS` or `FAIL`.
* `description`: A description of the operation. This will contain information about the URL that was opened.

If the URL is invalid, the method will return a result object with the following properties:

* `status`: The status of the operation. This will be `FAIL`.
* `description`: A description of the error. This will contain information about the invalid URL.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `goTo` method to open a URL in the browser:

```javascript
const config = {
  origin: "https://www.example.com",
  url: "/path/to/page",
};

const step = {
  origin: "https://www.example.com",
  url: "/path/to/page",
};

const driver = new WebDriver();

const result = goTo(config, step, driver);

console.log(result);
```

This example will open the URL `https://www.example.com/path/to/page` in the browser. If the URL is valid, the result object will have a status of `PASS` and a description of `Opened URL.`. If the URL is invalid, the result object will have a status of `FAIL` and a description of `Couldn't open URL.`.
