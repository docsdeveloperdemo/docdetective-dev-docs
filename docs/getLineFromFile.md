## What does this do?

The `getLineFromFile` function takes a file path and a line number as arguments and returns the contents of the specified line from the file.

## Why should I use this?

This function can be useful for reading specific lines from a file without having to load the entire file into memory. This can be especially useful for large files or when you only need to access a small amount of data from a file.

## Prerequisites

To use this function, you will need to have the `fs` module installed. You can install this module using the following command:

```
npm install fs
```

## How to use this

To use this function, simply call it with the file path and line number as arguments. For example, the following code will read the first line from the file `/Users/andrewvanbeek/dev-docs-work/clients/doc-detective-core/src/suggest.js`:

```
const fs = require('fs');

const line = getLineFromFile('/Users/andrewvanbeek/dev-docs-work/clients/doc-detective-core/src/suggest.js', 1);

console.log(line);
```

## Output

The output of the above code will be the contents of the first line from the file `/Users/andrewvanbeek/dev-docs-work/clients/doc-detective-core/src/suggest.js`.
