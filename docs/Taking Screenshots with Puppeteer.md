## What does this do?

The `buildScreenshot` function generates a screenshot of a web page or a specific element on the page. It takes a configuration object and a match object as input and returns an action object that can be used to save the screenshot.

## Why should I use this?

Screenshots can be useful for debugging purposes, or for creating visual documentation of a web page or application. They can also be used to capture the state of a web page at a specific point in time.

## Prerequisites

To use the `buildScreenshot` function, you will need to have the following:

- A web browser installed on your computer.
- The `puppeteer` library installed.
- A Node.js environment.

## How to use this

To use the `buildScreenshot` function, you will need to:

1. Import the `puppeteer` library into your Node.js script.
2. Create a configuration object that specifies the URL of the web page or element you want to capture, and the path where you want to save the screenshot.
3. Create a match object that specifies the text or element you want to capture.
4. Call the `buildScreenshot` function with the configuration object and match object as arguments.
5. The function will return an action object that you can use to save the screenshot.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `buildScreenshot` function to capture a screenshot of the Google homepage:

```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

async function main() {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://www.google.com');

  const config = {
    url: 'https://www.google.com',
    path: 'screenshot.png',
  };

  const match = {
    text: 'Google',
  };

  const action = buildScreenshot(config, match);

  await action.saveScreenshot();

  await browser.close();
}

main();
```

This example will create a screenshot of the Google homepage and save it to the file `screenshot.png`.
