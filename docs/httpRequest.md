## What does this do?

The `httpRequest` method performs an HTTP request and validates the response status code and data.

## Why should I use this?

The `httpRequest` method can be used to test the functionality of an HTTP endpoint by sending a request and validating the response. This can be useful for testing the behavior of a web service or API.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `httpRequest` method, you must have the following:

* An HTTP endpoint to test.
* A valid request payload.
* A list of expected status codes.

## How to use this

To use the `httpRequest` method, you must provide the following information:

* The URL of the HTTP endpoint.
* The HTTP method to use (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
* The request payload (if applicable).
* A list of expected status codes.

The `httpRequest` method will then perform the HTTP request and validate the response status code and data. If the response status code is not one of the expected status codes, the method will return an error.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `httpRequest` method to test the functionality of a web service:

```
const step = {
  url: "https://example.com/api/v1/users",
  method: "GET",
  statusCodes: [200],
  responseData: {
    id: 1,
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
  },
};

const result = httpRequest(step);

if (result.status === "PASS") {
  console.log("The HTTP request was successful.");
} else {
  console.log("The HTTP request failed.");
}
```

## Additional information

The `httpRequest` method can also be used to set environment variables from the response data. This can be useful for passing data from the HTTP response to other steps in a test script.

To set environment variables from the response data, you must provide the following information:

* The name of the environment variable.
* A jq filter to extract the value from the response data.

The `httpRequest` method will then use the jq filter to extract the value from the response data and set the environment variable.

## Conclusion

The `httpRequest` method is a powerful tool that can be used to test the functionality of HTTP endpoints. By providing the necessary information, you can use the `httpRequest` method to validate the response status code and data, and set environment variables from the response data.
