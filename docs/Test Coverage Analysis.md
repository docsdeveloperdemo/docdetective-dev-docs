## What does this do?

The `checkTestCoverage` function analyzes the test coverage of a set of files. It identifies which lines of code are covered by tests and which are not. This information can be used to improve the quality of the codebase by ensuring that all code is adequately tested.

## Why should I use this?

Test coverage analysis is an important tool for ensuring the quality of a codebase. By identifying which lines of code are not covered by tests, developers can prioritize writing tests for those areas. This can help to prevent bugs from being introduced into the codebase and can also make it easier to debug issues when they do occur.

## Prerequisites

To use the `checkTestCoverage` function, you will need to have the following installed:

* Node.js
* The `fs` module
* The `path` module

## How to use this

To use the `checkTestCoverage` function, simply pass it the configuration object and the array of files to be analyzed. The function will return an object containing the test coverage results.

Here is an example of how to use the `checkTestCoverage` function:

```javascript
const config = {
  fileTypes: [
    {
      extensions: [".js"],
      testStartStatementOpen: "/**",
      testStartStatementClose: "*/",
      testIgnoreStatement: "// ignore",
      testEndStatement: "*/",
      stepStatementOpen: "// step",
      stepStatementClose: "// end step",
    },
  ],
};

const files = ["file1.js", "file2.js"];

const testCoverage = checkTestCoverage(config, files);

console.log(testCoverage);
```

The output of the `checkTestCoverage` function will be an object containing the following properties:

* `files`: An array of objects, each of which represents a file that was analyzed.
* `errors`: An array of objects, each of which represents an error that occurred during the analysis.

The `files` array will contain the following properties for each file:

* `file`: The name of the file.
* `coveredLines`: An array of the line numbers that are covered by tests.
* `uncoveredLines`: An array of the line numbers that are not covered by tests.
* `fileType`: The file type of the file.

The `errors` array will contain the following properties for each error:

* `file`: The name of the file in which the error occurred.
* `lineNumber`: The line number on which the error occurred.
* `description`: A description of the error.
