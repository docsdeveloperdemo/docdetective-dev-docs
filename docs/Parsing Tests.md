## What does this do?

The `parseTests` function is responsible for parsing a set of test files and generating a list of test specifications. Each test specification represents a single test and contains information such as the test ID, file path, and an array of test steps.

## Why should I use this?

The `parseTests` function is useful for organizing and managing a collection of test files. It allows you to easily identify and access individual tests, as well as generate reports or other documentation based on the test specifications.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `parseTests` function, you will need to have a set of test files that you want to parse. These files can be in any format, but they must contain valid test data.

## How to use this

To use the `parseTests` function, you will need to provide it with the following parameters:

* `config`: A configuration object that contains settings for the test parser.
* `files`: An array of file paths to the test files that you want to parse.

The `parseTests` function will return an array of test specifications, each of which represents a single test.

## Example

The following code shows an example of how to use the `parseTests` function:

```javascript
const parseTests = require('./parseTests');

const config = {
  // Configuration settings for the test parser
};

const files = [
  // An array of file paths to the test files
];

const specs = parseTests(config, files);

// Use the test specifications to generate reports or other documentation
```

## Output

The `parseTests` function will return an array of test specifications, each of which represents a single test. Each test specification will contain the following information:

* `id`: A unique identifier for the test.
* `file`: The file path to the test file.
* `tests`: An array of test steps.

The test steps will contain the following information:

* `action`: The action to be performed.
* `params`: An object containing the parameters for the action.

## Additional notes

* The `parseTests` function can be used to parse test files in any format. However, it is important to ensure that the test files contain valid test data.
* The `parseTests` function can be used to generate reports or other documentation based on the test specifications.
* The `parseTests` function is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the organization and management of your test files.
