## What does this do?

The `httpRequest` action validates a URI by making a request to it.

## Why should I use this?

Use the `httpRequest` action to validate that a URI is reachable and returns a valid response. This can be useful for testing links in your documentation or for ensuring that external resources are available.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `httpRequest` action, you must have the following:

* A valid URI to validate.
* An internet connection.

## How to use this

To use the `httpRequest` action, follow these steps:

1.  In your documentation, add a `httpRequest` action block.
2.  In the `URI` field, enter the URI that you want to validate.
3.  Click the **Validate** button.

The `httpRequest` action will make a request to the specified URI and display the results in the **Response** field.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `httpRequest` action to validate a URI:

```

## Output

The output of the `httpRequest` action will vary depending on the response from the URI. If the URI is valid, the output will include the following information:

* The HTTP status code of the response.
* The content type of the response.
* The size of the response in bytes.
* The time it took to make the request.

If the URI is not valid, the output will include an error message.

## Troubleshooting

* Make sure that you have entered a valid URI.
* Make sure that you have an internet connection.
* Try using a different browser.
