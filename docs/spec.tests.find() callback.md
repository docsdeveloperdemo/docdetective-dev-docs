## What does this do?

The `findTestById` method is used to find a test by its ID. It takes an ID as an argument and returns the test object if it is found, or `undefined` if it is not.

## Why should I use this?

The `findTestById` method can be used to retrieve a specific test object by its ID. This can be useful for getting more information about a test, or for running a specific test.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using the `findTestById` method.

## How to use this

To use the `findTestById` method, simply call it with the ID of the test you want to find. The method will return the test object if it is found, or `undefined` if it is not.

Here is an example of how to use the `findTestById` method:

```javascript
const test = spec.tests.find((test) => test.id === id);
```

In this example, the `findTestById` method is used to find a test with the ID `id`. If the test is found, it is assigned to the `test` variable. Otherwise, the `test` variable is assigned to `undefined`.
