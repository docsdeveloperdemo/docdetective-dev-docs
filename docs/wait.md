## What does this do?

The `wait` method pauses the execution of the test for a specified duration. This can be useful for waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete, such as a network request or a database query.

## Why should I use this?

The `wait` method can be used to ensure that the test does not proceed until a certain condition is met. This can help to prevent the test from failing due to race conditions or other timing issues.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using the `wait` method.

## How to use this

To use the `wait` method, you must specify the duration of the wait in milliseconds. You can also specify a step object that contains additional information about the wait, such as the reason for the wait and the expected outcome.

The following example shows how to use the `wait` method:

```
async function wait(config, step) {
  let result = { status: "PASS", description: "Waited." };

  // Validate step payload
  isValidStep = validate("wait_v2", step);
  if (!isValidStep.valid) {
    result.status = "FAIL";
    result.description = `Invalid step definition: ${isValidStep.errors}`;
    return result;
  }

  // Run action
  try {
    await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, step.duration));
  } catch {
    // FAIL: Error waiting
    result.status = "FAIL";
    result.description = "Couldn't wait.";
    return result;
  }
  
  // PASS
  return result;
}
```

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `wait` method to wait for a network request to complete:

```
async function testNetworkRequest() {
  // Make a network request
  const response = await fetch("https://example.com");

  // Wait for the response to be received
  const result = await wait(config, {
    duration: 5000,
    reason: "Waiting for network request to complete",
    expectedOutcome: "Response received"
  });

  // Check the result of the wait
  if (result.status === "FAIL") {
    throw new Error("Network request failed");
  }

  // Continue with the test
}
```
