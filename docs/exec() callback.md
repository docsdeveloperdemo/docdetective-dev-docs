## What does this do?

The `exec` method executes the specified command in the shell and returns the output.

## Why should I use this?

The `exec` method can be used to execute any command in the shell, including commands that are not available in the Node.js standard library. This can be useful for tasks such as running system commands, managing files, and interacting with other programs.

## Prerequisites

To use the `exec` method, you must have the `child_process` module installed. You can install the `child_process` module by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install child_process
```

## How to use this

To use the `exec` method, you must first create a `child_process` object. You can do this by calling the `child_process.exec` function. The `child_process.exec` function takes two arguments: the command to execute and a callback function. The callback function is called when the command has finished executing.

The following example shows how to use the `exec` method to execute the `ls` command in the shell:

```
const { exec } = require('child_process');

exec('ls', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return;
  }

  console.log(stdout);
});
```

The output of the `ls` command will be printed to the console.

## Additional information

The `exec` method can also be used to execute commands in the background. To do this, you must pass the `detached` option to the `child_process.exec` function. The following example shows how to use the `exec` method to execute the `ls` command in the background:

```
const { exec } = require('child_process');

exec('ls', { detached: true });
```

The `ls` command will be executed in the background and will not print any output to the console.
