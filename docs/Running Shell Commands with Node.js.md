## What does this do?

The `runShell` method executes a shell command and returns the result.

## Why should I use this?

The `runShell` method can be used to execute any shell command from within your Node.js application. This can be useful for a variety of tasks, such as:

* Running system commands
* Executing scripts
* Interacting with other programs

## Prerequisites

To use the `runShell` method, you must have the following:

* A Node.js application
* The `spawnCommand` module installed

## How to use this

To use the `runShell` method, simply call it with the following arguments:

* `command`: The shell command to execute
* `args`: An array of arguments to pass to the command

The `runShell` method will return a promise that resolves to an object with the following properties:

* `status`: The status of the command (either "PASS" or "FAIL")
* `description`: A description of the command's output
* `exitCode`: The exit code of the command
* `stdout`: The standard output of the command
* `stderr`: The standard error of the command

Here is an example of how to use the `runShell` method:

```javascript
const { runShell } = require('doc-detective-core');

async function main() {
  const result = await runShell('ls', ['-l']);

  console.log(result);
}

main();
```

## Output

The output of the `runShell` method will vary depending on the command that is executed.

For example, if you execute the `ls` command with the `-l` argument, the output will be a list of files and directories in the current directory, along with their permissions, sizes, and modification dates.
