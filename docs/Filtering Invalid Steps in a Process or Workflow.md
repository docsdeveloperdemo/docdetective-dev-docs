The `filterInvalidSteps` function filters out any invalid steps from an array of steps. A step is considered invalid if it does not pass the validation check for the specified action version.

## Why should I use this?

This function is useful for ensuring that only valid steps are used in a process or workflow. By filtering out invalid steps, you can avoid errors and ensure that your code runs smoothly.

## Prerequisites

Before using this function, you must have the following:

- An array of steps to filter.
- A validation function for the specified action version.

## How to use this

To use this function, simply pass the array of steps and the validation function as arguments. The function will return a new array containing only the valid steps.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```
const steps = [
  { action: 'step1', data: {} },
  { action: 'step2', data: {} },
  { action: 'step3', data: {} }
];

const validationFunction = (action, step) => {
  // Validation logic here
};

const filteredSteps = filterInvalidSteps(steps, validationFunction);
```

The `filteredSteps` array will now contain only the valid steps from the original array.

## Additional notes

- The validation function should return a boolean value indicating whether the step is valid or not.
- If the validation function throws an error, the step will be considered invalid.
- This function can be used to filter out invalid steps from any type of array, not just arrays of steps.
