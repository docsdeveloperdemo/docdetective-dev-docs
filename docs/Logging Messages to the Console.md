## What does this do?

The `log` function is a utility function that logs messages to the console based on a specified log level. It takes three parameters:

- `config`: An object containing the log level configuration.
- `level`: The log level of the message.
- `message`: The message to log.

## Why should I use this?

The `log` function provides a consistent way to log messages to the console, making it easier to debug and troubleshoot your code. It also allows you to control the level of detail that is logged, so that you can avoid logging unnecessary information.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using the `log` function.

## How to use this

To use the `log` function, simply call it with the appropriate parameters. For example, the following code logs an error message to the console:

```
log({ logLevel: "error" }, "error", "An error occurred.");
```

You can also log objects to the console by passing them as the `message` parameter. For example, the following code logs an object to the console:

```
log({ logLevel: "info" }, "info", { foo: "bar" });
```

## Relevant method or class

The `log` function is a utility function that is not specific to any particular method or class. However, it can be used in conjunction with any method or class that needs to log messages to the console.

## Example

The following example shows how the `log` function can be used to log messages to the console:

```
// Import the log function.
import { log } from "./utils.js";

// Create a configuration object.
const config = {
  logLevel: "info",
};

// Log an error message to the console.
log(config, "error", "An error occurred.");

// Log an info message to the console.
log(config, "info", { foo: "bar" });
```
