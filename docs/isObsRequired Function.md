## What does this do?

The `isObsRequired` function checks if a set of test specifications require the OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) to be used for recording.

## Why should I use this?

The `isObsRequired` function can be used to determine if the OBS is needed for recording a set of tests. This can be useful for optimizing the testing process by only using the OBS when it is necessary.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using the `isObsRequired` function.

## How to use this

To use the `isObsRequired` function, simply pass in a set of test specifications as the argument. The function will return a boolean value indicating whether or not the OBS is required for recording the tests.

Here is an example of how to use the `isObsRequired` function:

```javascript
const specs = [
  {
    tests: [
      {
        steps: [
          {
            action: "startRecording"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
];

const obsRequired = isObsRequired(specs);

if (obsRequired) {
  // Use the OBS to record the tests.
} else {
  // Do not use the OBS to record the tests.
}
```

## Additional notes

The `isObsRequired` function only checks for the presence of the `startRecording` action in the test steps. If there are other actions that require the OBS, the function will not detect them.
