## What does this do?

The `goTo` method opens a URL in the browser.

## Why should I use this?

Use this method to navigate to a specific URL in the browser. This can be useful for testing web applications or automating tasks that require opening specific web pages.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `goTo` method, you must have a valid URL to open.

## How to use this

To use the `goTo` method, pass in the URL you want to open as the first argument. You can also pass in an optional second argument, which is a configuration object. The configuration object can contain the following properties:

* `origin`: The origin of the URL. This is the protocol and domain of the URL.
* `url`: The path of the URL. This is the part of the URL that comes after the origin.

For example, the following code opens the URL "https://www.google.com" in the browser:

```
await goTo("https://www.google.com");
```

The following code opens the URL "https://www.google.com/search" in the browser, with the origin set to "https://www.google.com":

```
await goTo({
  origin: "https://www.google.com",
  url: "/search"
});
```

## Validation

The `goTo` method validates the step payload to ensure that it is valid. If the step payload is not valid, the method returns a result object with the status set to "FAIL" and the description set to the error message.

## Error handling

The `goTo` method handles errors that occur when opening the URL. If an error occurs, the method returns a result object with the status set to "FAIL" and the description set to the error message.
