## What does this do?

The `isValidSourceFile` function determines if a given file is a valid source file for the Doc Detective tool. It performs several checks to ensure that the file is valid, including:

- Checking if the file is already present in the `files` array.
- Checking if the file is a JSON file and if it is a valid spec-formatted JSON object.
- Checking if any objects in the `tests` array have `setup` or `cleanup` properties and if those files exist.
- Checking if the file extension is in the list of allowed extensions specified in the `config.fileTypes` object.

## Why should I use this?

The `isValidSourceFile` function is used to ensure that only valid source files are included in the Doc Detective analysis. This helps to ensure that the documentation generated by Doc Detective is accurate and complete.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `isValidSourceFile` function, you must have the following:

- A valid Doc Detective configuration file.
- A list of files to be analyzed.

## How to use this

To use the `isValidSourceFile` function, you must pass the following parameters:

- `config`: The Doc Detective configuration file.
- `files`: The list of files to be analyzed.
- `source`: The path to the source file to be validated.

The function will return `true` if the source file is valid and `false` if it is not.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `isValidSourceFile` function:

```javascript
const isValidSourceFile = require('doc-detective-core/src/utils').isValidSourceFile;

const config = {
  fileTypes: [
    {
      extensions: ['.json']
    }
  ]
};

const files = ['test.json', 'setup.js', 'cleanup.js'];

const source = 'test.json';

const isValid = isValidSourceFile(config, files, source);

if (isValid) {
  // The source file is valid.
} else {
  // The source file is not valid.
}
```
