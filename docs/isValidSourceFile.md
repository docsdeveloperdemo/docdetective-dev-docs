## What does this do?

The `isValidSourceFile` function determines whether a given source file is valid for inclusion in the documentation. It performs several checks, including:

- Checking if the file is already present in the `files` array.
- Checking if the file is a valid JSON file with a valid spec-formatted JSON object.
- Checking if any objects in the `tests` array have `setup` or `cleanup` properties and ensuring that those files exist.
- Checking if the file extension is included in the list of allowed extensions specified in the `config.fileTypes` object.

## Why should I use this?

The `isValidSourceFile` function is used to ensure that only valid source files are included in the documentation. This helps to maintain the accuracy and consistency of the documentation.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `isValidSourceFile` function, you must:

- Have a `config` object that specifies the allowed file types and other configuration options.
- Have a `files` array that contains the paths to the source files that are being considered for inclusion in the documentation.

## How to use this

To use the `isValidSourceFile` function, you can call it with the following parameters:

```
isValidSourceFile(config, files, source)
```

- `config`: The configuration object that specifies the allowed file types and other configuration options.
- `files`: The array of paths to the source files that are being considered for inclusion in the documentation.
- `source`: The path to the source file that is being checked for validity.

The function will return `true` if the source file is valid and `false` if it is not.
