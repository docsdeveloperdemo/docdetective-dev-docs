## What does this do?

The `constructPrompt` function is used to construct a prompt for the user to input a value. It takes two parameters:

* `prompt`: The text of the prompt.
* `defaultValue`: The default value for the prompt.

If a default value is provided, it will be displayed in square brackets after the prompt. For example, if the prompt is "Enter your name" and the default value is "John Doe", the prompt will be displayed as "Enter your name [John Doe]: ".

## Why should I use this?

The `constructPrompt` function is useful for creating prompts that are easy for the user to understand and respond to. By providing a default value, you can also help the user to enter the correct value.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using the `constructPrompt` function.

## How to use this

To use the `constructPrompt` function, simply call it with the desired prompt and default value. For example, the following code will create a prompt for the user to enter their name:

```
const prompt = constructPrompt("Enter your name");
```

The user will then be prompted to enter their name. If they do not enter a value, the default value of "John Doe" will be used.

## Example

The following example shows how the `constructPrompt` function can be used to create a prompt for the user to enter their age:

```
const prompt = constructPrompt("Enter your age", 18);

const age = prompt();

console.log(`Your age is ${age}.`);
```

In this example, the user will be prompted to enter their age. If they do not enter a value, the default value of 18 will be used. The user's age will then be printed to the console.
