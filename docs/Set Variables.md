## What does this do?

The `setVariables` method sets environment variables for the current process.

## Why should I use this?

You should use this method to set environment variables for your application. This can be useful for setting up configuration values, such as the database connection string or the port number to listen on.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using this method.

## How to use this

To use this method, you must first create a `step` object. The `step` object must contain the following properties:

* `path`: The path to the environment variables file.
* `variables`: An object containing the environment variables to set.

Once you have created the `step` object, you can call the `setVariables` method. The `setVariables` method will return a `result` object. The `result` object will contain the following properties:

* `status`: The status of the operation. This can be either "PASS" or "FAIL".
* `description`: A description of the operation.

If the `status` property is "PASS", then the environment variables were set successfully. If the `status` property is "FAIL", then the environment variables were not set successfully. The `description` property will contain more information about the failure.

Here is an example of how to use the `setVariables` method:

```javascript
const step = {
  path: '/path/to/env.json',
  variables: {
    DATABASE_URL: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/my_database',
    PORT: 3000
  }
};

const result = setVariables(step);

if (result.status === 'PASS') {
  console.log('Environment variables set successfully.');
} else {
  console.log('Environment variables not set successfully.');
  console.log(result.description);
}
```
