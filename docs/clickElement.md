## What does this do?

The `clickElement` function clicks on a given element in the DOM. If the element is successfully clicked, the function returns a `PASS` status and a description indicating that the element was clicked. If the element cannot be clicked, the function returns a `FAIL` status and a description indicating that the element could not be clicked.

## Why should I use this?

The `clickElement` function can be used to automate the process of clicking on elements in the DOM. This can be useful for testing purposes or for creating user interfaces that interact with the DOM.

## Prerequisites

To use the `clickElement` function, you must have a reference to the element that you want to click. This can be obtained by using the `document.querySelector()` method or by using a library like jQuery.

## How to use this

To use the `clickElement` function, simply pass the element that you want to click as the first argument to the function. The function will then attempt to click on the element and return a `PASS` or `FAIL` status.

Here is an example of how to use the `clickElement` function:

```javascript
const element = document.querySelector('.button');
const result = clickElement(element);

if (result.status === 'PASS') {
  // The element was successfully clicked.
} else {
  // The element could not be clicked.
}
```

## Additional notes

The `clickElement` function can also be used to click on elements that are not visible on the screen. To do this, you can use the `scrollIntoView()` method to scroll the element into view before clicking on it.

Here is an example of how to use the `scrollIntoView()` method to click on an element that is not visible on the screen:

```javascript
const element = document.querySelector('.button');
element.scrollIntoView();
const result = clickElement(element);

if (result.status === 'PASS') {
  // The element was successfully clicked.
} else {
  // The element could not be clicked.
}
```
