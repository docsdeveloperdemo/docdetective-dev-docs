## What does this do?

The `runStep` function is the main entry point for executing a single step in a test case. It takes a configuration object, a step object, and a WebDriver instance as input, and returns an action result object.

## Why should I use this?

The `runStep` function is used to execute a single step in a test case. It is a convenient way to encapsulate the logic for executing a step, and it can be used to easily create test cases that are composed of multiple steps.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `runStep` function, you must have the following prerequisites:

* A configuration object that contains the necessary information for executing the test case.
* A step object that contains the information about the step to be executed.
* A WebDriver instance that is used to interact with the browser.

## How to use this

To use the `runStep` function, simply call it with the following arguments:

* `config`: The configuration object.
* `step`: The step object.
* `driver`: The WebDriver instance.

The `runStep` function will then execute the step and return an action result object. The action result object will contain the status of the step (either "PASS" or "FAIL") and a description of the result.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `runStep` function to execute a single step in a test case:

```javascript
async function runTest() {
  // Create a configuration object.
  const config = {
    // ...
  };

  // Create a step object.
  const step = {
    // ...
  };

  // Create a WebDriver instance.
  const driver = new WebDriver();

  // Execute the step.
  const actionResult = await runStep(config, step, driver);

  // Check the status of the step.
  if (actionResult.status === "PASS") {
    // The step passed.
  } else {
    // The step failed.
  }
}
```
