## What does this do?

The `object.line === matchObject.line && object.text === matchObject.text && object.indexInFile === matchObject.indexInFile` function checks if two objects are equal. It does this by comparing the line number, text, and index in file of the two objects. If all three of these properties are equal, then the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

## Why should I use this?

This function can be used to compare two objects to see if they are equal. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as:

* Checking if two objects have the same content.
* Checking if two objects have been modified.
* Finding duplicate objects in a list.

## Prequsites

There are no prerequisites for using this function.

## How to use this

To use this function, simply pass two objects as arguments. The function will then return `true` if the two objects are equal, or `false` if they are not.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```javascript
const object1 = {
  line: 1,
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  indexInFile: 0
};

const object2 = {
  line: 1,
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  indexInFile: 0
};

const areEqual = object.line === matchObject.line && object.text === matchObject.text && object.indexInFile === matchObject.indexInFile(object1, object2);

console.log(areEqual); // true
```

## Conclusion

The `object.line === matchObject.line && object.text === matchObject.text && object.indexInFile === matchObject.indexInFile` function is a simple but useful function that can be used to compare two objects to see if they are equal.
