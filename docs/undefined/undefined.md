## What does this do?

The `remoteJSON.forEach` method iterates over each specification in the `remoteJSON` array. For each specification, it calls the `spec.tests.forEach` method to iterate over each test in the `spec.tests` array. Inside the `spec.tests.forEach` method, it checks if the `test.id` property of the current test matches the `statementJson.id` property. If they match, it sets the `idMatch` variable to `true`.

## Why should I use this?

This code is used to check if a statement is present in a set of specifications. This can be useful for various purposes, such as validating that a statement is included in a set of tests, or for generating documentation for a statement.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, you must have the following:

* A set of specifications in JSON format.
* A statement in JSON format.

## How to use this

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Load the specifications into a JavaScript object.
2. Load the statement into a JavaScript object.
3. Call the `remoteJSON.forEach` method on the specifications object.
4. Inside the `remoteJSON.forEach` method, call the `spec.tests.forEach` method on the current specification object.
5. Inside the `spec.tests.forEach` method, check if the `test.id` property of the current test matches the `statementJson.id` property.
6. If they match, set the `idMatch` variable to `true`.

The `idMatch` variable will be `true` if the statement is present in the set of specifications, and `false` otherwise.
