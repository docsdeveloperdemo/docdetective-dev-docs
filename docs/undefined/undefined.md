## What does this do?

The `checkTestCoverage` function analyzes the test coverage of a set of files. It identifies which lines of code are covered by tests and which are not.

## Why should I use this?

Test coverage analysis is important for ensuring that your code is thoroughly tested. By identifying which lines of code are not covered by tests, you can prioritize your testing efforts and improve the overall quality of your code.

## Prerequisites

To use the `checkTestCoverage` function, you will need to have the following:

* A set of files to analyze.
* A configuration file that specifies the file types to be analyzed and the test coverage criteria to be used.

## How to use this

To use the `checkTestCoverage` function, follow these steps:

1. Import the `checkTestCoverage` function into your code.
2. Call the `checkTestCoverage` function with the following arguments:
    * The configuration file.
    * The set of files to analyze.
3. The function will return a test coverage report that contains the following information:
    * The files that were analyzed.
    * The lines of code that are covered by tests.
    * The lines of code that are not covered by tests.
    * Any errors that occurred during the analysis.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `checkTestCoverage` function to analyze the test coverage of a set of files:

```javascript
const checkTestCoverage = require('./checkTestCoverage');

const config = {
  fileTypes: [
    {
      extensions: ['.js'],
      testStartStatementOpen: '// Test start',
      testStartStatementClose: '// Test end',
      testIgnoreStatement: '// Test ignore',
      stepStatementOpen: '// Step start',
      stepStatementClose: '// Step end',
    },
  ],
};

const files = ['file1.js', 'file2.js'];

const testCoverage = checkTestCoverage(config, files);

console.log(testCoverage);
```

The output of the above example will be a test coverage report that contains the following information:

```json
{
  files: [
    {
      file: 'file1.js',
      coveredLines: [1, 2, 3],
      uncoveredLines: [4, 5],
      fileType: {
        extensions: ['.js'],
        testStartStatementOpen: '// Test start',
        testStartStatementClose: '// Test end',
        testIgnoreStatement: '// Test ignore',
        stepStatementOpen: '// Step start',
        stepStatementClose: '// Step end',
      },
    },
    {
      file: 'file2.js',
      coveredLines: [1, 2, 3],
      uncoveredLines: [4, 5],
      fileType: {
        extensions: ['.js'],
        testStartStatementOpen: '// Test start',
        testStartStatementClose: '// Test end',
        testIgnoreStatement: '// Test ignore',
        stepStatementOpen: '// Step start',
        stepStatementClose: '// Step end',
      },
    },
  ],
  errors: [],
}
```
