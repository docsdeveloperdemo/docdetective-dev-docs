## What does this do?

The `checkTestCoverage` function analyzes the test coverage of a set of files. It identifies which lines of code are covered by tests and which lines are not. This information can be used to improve the quality of the codebase by ensuring that all code is adequately tested.

## Why should I use this?

Test coverage analysis is an important tool for ensuring the quality of a codebase. By identifying which lines of code are not covered by tests, developers can prioritize writing tests for those areas of the code that are most likely to contain bugs. This can help to prevent defects from being introduced into the codebase and can also help to improve the overall reliability of the software.

## Prerequisites

To use the `checkTestCoverage` function, you will need to have the following prerequisites:

* A set of files to analyze.
* A configuration file that specifies the file types to be analyzed and the test coverage criteria to be used.

## How to use this

To use the `checkTestCoverage` function, follow these steps:

1. Create a configuration file that specifies the file types to be analyzed and the test coverage criteria to be used.
2. Call the `checkTestCoverage` function with the configuration file and the set of files to be analyzed.
3. The function will return a test coverage report that identifies which lines of code are covered by tests and which lines are not.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `checkTestCoverage` function to analyze the test coverage of a set of files:

```javascript
const config = {
  fileTypes: [
    {
      extensions: [".js"],
      testStartStatementOpen: "describe(",
      testStartStatementClose: ")",
      testIgnoreStatement: "@ignore",
      testEndStatement: "}",
      stepStatementOpen: "it(",
      stepStatementClose: ")",
    },
  ],
};

const files = ["file1.js", "file2.js"];

const testCoverage = checkTestCoverage(config, files);

console.log(testCoverage);
```

The output of the `checkTestCoverage` function will be a test coverage report that identifies which lines of code are covered by tests and which lines are not. This information can be used to improve the quality of the codebase by ensuring that all code is adequately tested.
