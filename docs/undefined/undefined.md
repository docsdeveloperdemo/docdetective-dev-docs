## What does this do?

The `remoteJSON.forEach` method iterates over each element in the `remoteJSON` array and executes the provided callback function for each element. The callback function takes a single argument, which is the current element in the array.

In this case, the callback function is an anonymous function that checks if the `id` property of the current element in the `remoteJSON` array matches the `id` property of the `statementJson` object. If the two `id` properties match, the `idMatch` variable is set to `true`.

## Why should I use this?

The `remoteJSON.forEach` method can be used to iterate over an array and perform a specific action for each element in the array. In this case, the callback function is used to check if the `id` property of the current element in the `remoteJSON` array matches the `id` property of the `statementJson` object. This can be useful for finding a specific element in an array or for performing a specific action on each element in an array.

## Prequsites

There are no prerequisites for using the `remoteJSON.forEach` method.

## How to use this

To use the `remoteJSON.forEach` method, you simply call the method on the `remoteJSON` array and pass in a callback function as the first argument. The callback function will be executed for each element in the array.

In this example, the `remoteJSON.forEach` method is used to iterate over the `remoteJSON` array and check if the `id` property of the current element in the array matches the `id` property of the `statementJson` object. If the two `id` properties match, the `idMatch` variable is set to `true`.

```javascript
remoteJSON.forEach((spec) => {
  spec.tests.forEach((test) => {
    if (test.id && test.id === statementJson.id) idMatch = true;
  });
});
```

## Conclusion

The `remoteJSON.forEach` method is a powerful tool that can be used to iterate over an array and perform a specific action for each element in the array. In this case, the callback function is used to check if the `id` property of the current element in the `remoteJSON` array matches the `id` property of the `statementJson` object. This can be useful for finding a specific element in an array or for performing a specific action on each element in an array.
