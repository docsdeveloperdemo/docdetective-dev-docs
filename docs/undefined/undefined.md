## What does this do?

The `remoteJSON.forEach` method iterates over each element in the `remoteJSON` array and executes the provided callback function for each element. The callback function takes a single argument, which is the current element in the array.

In this case, the callback function is an anonymous function that checks if the `id` property of the current element in the `remoteJSON` array matches the `id` property of the `statementJson` object. If the `id` properties match, the `idMatch` variable is set to `true`.

## Why should I use this?

The `remoteJSON.forEach` method can be used to iterate over an array and perform a specific action for each element in the array. In this case, the callback function is used to check if the `id` property of the current element in the `remoteJSON` array matches the `id` property of the `statementJson` object. This can be useful for finding a specific element in an array or for performing a specific action for each element in an array.

## Prequsites

There are no prerequisites for using the `remoteJSON.forEach` method.

## How to use this

To use the `remoteJSON.forEach` method, you simply call the method on the `remoteJSON` array and pass in a callback function as the first argument. The callback function will be executed for each element in the array.

In the example code, the `remoteJSON.forEach` method is used to iterate over the `remoteJSON` array and check if the `id` property of the current element in the array matches the `id` property of the `statementJson` object. If the `id` properties match, the `idMatch` variable is set to `true`.

Here is an example of how you could use the `remoteJSON.forEach` method to iterate over an array and print the value of each element to the console:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.forEach((number) => {
  console.log(number);
});
```

This code would print the following output to the console:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```
