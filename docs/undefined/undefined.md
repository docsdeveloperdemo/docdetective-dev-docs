## What does this do?

The `analysis.js` file contains a function that takes an object as an argument and checks if the object's line, text, and indexInFile properties match the properties of a given matchObject.

## Why should I use this?

This function can be used to compare two objects and determine if they are the same. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as checking if a file has been modified or if two objects are equivalent.

## Prequsites

There are no prerequisites for using this function.

## How to use this

To use this function, simply pass an object as an argument to the function. The function will then return a boolean value indicating whether or not the object's properties match the properties of the matchObject.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```
const object1 = {
  line: 1,
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  indexInFile: 0
};

const object2 = {
  line: 1,
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  indexInFile: 0
};

const result = compareObjects(object1, object2);

console.log(result); // true
```

In this example, the two objects are the same, so the function returns true.

## Conclusion

The `analysis.js` file contains a useful function that can be used to compare two objects and determine if they are the same. This function can be used for a variety of purposes, such as checking if a file has been modified or if two objects are equivalent.
