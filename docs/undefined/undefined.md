## What does this do?

The `analysis.js` file is responsible for analyzing files and extracting relevant information for documentation generation. It supports various file types, including JavaScript, TypeScript, and Markdown.

## Why should I use this?

Using this file allows you to easily generate documentation for your code without manually extracting information. It provides a consistent and structured approach to documentation, ensuring that all relevant information is included.

## Prerequisites

To use this file, you must have the following:

- Node.js installed
- The `doc-detective-core` package installed

## How to use this

To use this file, follow these steps:

1. Import the `analysis` module into your project.
2. Call the `analyzeFile` function with the path to the file you want to analyze.
3. The function will return an object containing the extracted information from the file.
4. Use the extracted information to generate documentation for your code.

Here is an example of how to use the `analysis` module:

```javascript
const analysis = require('doc-detective-core/analysis');

const filePath = '/path/to/file.js';

const analysisResult = analysis.analyzeFile(filePath);

console.log(analysisResult);
```

The `analysisResult` object will contain the following information:

- `fileType`: The type of file (e.g. JavaScript, TypeScript, Markdown).
- `fileName`: The name of the file.
- `fileContent`: The content of the file.
- `methods`: An array of methods extracted from the file.
- `classes`: An array of classes extracted from the file.
- `imports`: An array of imports extracted from the file.
- `exports`: An array of exports extracted from the file.

You can use this information to generate documentation for your code. For example, you could use the `methods` array to generate a list of methods with their descriptions, or the `classes` array to generate a list of classes with their properties and methods.
