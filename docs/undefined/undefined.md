## What does this do?
This method checks if the given object matches the matchObject.

## Why should I use this?
This method is useful for finding objects in an array that match a certain criteria.

## Prerequisites
None.

## How to use this
To use this method, pass the object you want to check as the first argument and the matchObject as the second argument. The method will return true if the object matches the matchObject, and false otherwise.

For example, the following code checks if the object `{ line: 1, text: "Hello, world!", indexInFile: 0 }` matches the matchObject `{ line: 1, text: "Hello, world!" }`.

```
const object = { line: 1, text: "Hello, world!", indexInFile: 0 };
const matchObject = { line: 1, text: "Hello, world!" };

const result = objectMatches(object, matchObject);

console.log(result); // true
```

## Additional information
The `objectMatches` method can be used to find objects in an array that match a certain criteria. This can be useful for a variety of tasks, such as filtering data or finding duplicate objects.
