## What does this do?

The `checkTestCoverage` function analyzes the test coverage of a set of files. It identifies which lines of code are covered by tests and which lines are not. This information can be used to improve the quality of the codebase by ensuring that all code is covered by tests.

## Why should I use this?

Test coverage analysis is an important tool for ensuring the quality of a codebase. By identifying which lines of code are not covered by tests, developers can prioritize writing tests for those lines of code. This can help to prevent bugs from being introduced into the codebase and can also help to improve the overall reliability of the code.

## Prerequisites

To use the `checkTestCoverage` function, you will need to have the following prerequisites:

* Node.js installed
* The `doc-detective-core` package installed

## How to use this

To use the `checkTestCoverage` function, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the `checkTestCoverage` function from the `doc-detective-core` package.
2. Call the `checkTestCoverage` function with the following parameters:
    * `config`: A configuration object that specifies the file types to be analyzed and the test start and end statements.
    * `files`: An array of files to be analyzed.
3. The `checkTestCoverage` function will return a test coverage object that contains the following information:
    * `files`: An array of file objects that contain the following information:
        * `file`: The name of the file.
        * `coveredLines`: An array of line numbers that are covered by tests.
        * `uncoveredLines`: An array of line numbers that are not covered by tests.
        * `fileType`: The file type of the file.
    * `errors`: An array of errors that occurred during the analysis.

You can use the test coverage object to identify which lines of code are not covered by tests and to prioritize writing tests for those lines of code.

## Example

The following is an example of how to use the `checkTestCoverage` function:

```javascript
const { checkTestCoverage } = require('doc-detective-core');

const config = {
  fileTypes: [
    {
      extensions: ['.js'],
      testStartStatementOpen: '// Test start',
      testStartStatementClose: '// Test end',
      testIgnoreStatement: '// Test ignore',
      stepStatementOpen: '// Step start',
      stepStatementClose: '// Step end',
    },
  ],
};

const files = ['file1.js', 'file2.js'];

const testCoverage = checkTestCoverage(config, files);

console.log(testCoverage);
```

The output of the above example will be a test coverage object that contains the following information:

```json
{
  files: [
    {
      file: 'file1.js',
      coveredLines: [1, 2, 3],
      uncoveredLines: [4, 5, 6],
      fileType: {
        extensions: ['.js'],
        testStartStatementOpen: '// Test start',
        testStartStatementClose: '// Test end',
        testIgnoreStatement: '// Test ignore',
        stepStatementOpen: '// Step start',
        stepStatementClose: '// Step end',
      },
    },
    {
      file: 'file2.js',
      coveredLines: [1, 2, 3],
      uncoveredLines: [4, 5, 6],
      fileType: {
        extensions: ['.js'],
        testStartStatementOpen: '// Test start',
        testStartStatementClose: '// Test end',
        testIgnoreStatement: '// Test ignore',
        stepStatementOpen: '// Step start',
        stepStatementClose: '// Step end',
      },
    },
  ],
  errors: [],
}
```

You can use the test coverage object to identify which lines of code are not covered by tests and to prioritize writing tests for those lines of code.
