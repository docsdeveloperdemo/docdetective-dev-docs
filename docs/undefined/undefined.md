## What does this do?
This function checks if a test ID matches the ID of a statement.

## Why should I use this?
This function is used to determine if a test is relevant to a particular statement. This information can be used to filter tests and only run the ones that are relevant to the statement being analyzed.

## Prerequisites
None.

## How to use this
To use this function, you must provide a test object and a statement object. The test object must have an `id` property, and the statement object must have an `id` property. The function will return `true` if the test ID matches the statement ID, and `false` otherwise.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```javascript
const test = {
  id: '12345',
  name: 'My test',
  ...
};

const statement = {
  id: '12345',
  type: 'function',
  ...
};

const idMatch = spec.tests.forEach((test) => {
  if (test.id && test.id === statementJson.id) idMatch = true;
});

if (idMatch) {
  // The test is relevant to the statement.
} else {
  // The test is not relevant to the statement.
}
```

## Additional notes
- The `id` property of the test object and the `id` property of the statement object must be of the same type.
- If either the test object or the statement object does not have an `id` property, the function will return `false`.
