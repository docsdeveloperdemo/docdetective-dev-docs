## What does this do?

The `forEach` method in `analysis.js` iterates over each test in the `spec.tests` array and checks if the `id` property of the test matches the `id` property of the `statementJson` object. If a match is found, the `idMatch` variable is set to `true`.

## Why should I use this?

This code is used to check if a statement has a corresponding test in the test suite. This information can be used to generate documentation or to identify untested code.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, you must have the following:

* A JavaScript runtime environment
* The `analysis.js` file

## How to use this

To use this code, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the `analysis.js` file into your project.
2. Call the `forEach` method on the `spec.tests` array.
3. Pass a callback function to the `forEach` method that checks if the `id` property of the test matches the `id` property of the `statementJson` object.
4. If a match is found, set the `idMatch` variable to `true`.

Here is an example of how you can use this code:

```javascript
import analysis from './analysis.js';

const spec = {
  tests: [
    {
      id: 'test1',
      name: 'Test 1'
    },
    {
      id: 'test2',
      name: 'Test 2'
    }
  ]
};

const statementJson = {
  id: 'test1'
};

analysis.forEach(spec.tests, (test) => {
  if (test.id && test.id === statementJson.id) idMatch = true;
});

if (idMatch) {
  // The statement has a corresponding test in the test suite.
} else {
  // The statement does not have a corresponding test in the test suite.
}
```
