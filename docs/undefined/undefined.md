## What does this do?

The `analysis.js` file is responsible for analyzing files and extracting relevant information for documentation generation. It takes a file path and an extension as input and returns an object containing the extracted information.

## Why should I use this?

The `analysis.js` file can be used to automatically generate documentation for your codebase. This can save you time and effort, and ensure that your documentation is always up-to-date.

## Prerequisites

To use the `analysis.js` file, you will need to have the following installed:

* Node.js
* The `doc-detective-core` package

## How to use this

To use the `analysis.js` file, simply import it into your project and call the `analyzeFile()` function. The function will take a file path and an extension as input and return an object containing the extracted information.

Here is an example of how to use the `analysis.js` file:

```javascript
const analysis = require('doc-detective-core/analysis');

const filePath = '/Users/andrewvanbeek/dev-docs-work/clients/doc-detective-core/src/analysis.js';
const extension = 'js';

const analysisResult = analysis.analyzeFile(filePath, extension);

console.log(analysisResult);
```

The `analysisResult` object will contain the following information:

* **File path:** The path to the file that was analyzed.
* **Extension:** The extension of the file that was analyzed.
* **File type:** The type of file that was analyzed.
* **Methods:** A list of the methods that were found in the file.
* **Classes:** A list of the classes that were found in the file.
* **Properties:** A list of the properties that were found in the file.
* **Constants:** A list of the constants that were found in the file.

You can use this information to generate documentation for your codebase. For example, you could use the list of methods to create a table of contents for your documentation. You could also use the list of classes to create a class reference.

## Conclusion

The `analysis.js` file is a powerful tool that can be used to automatically generate documentation for your codebase. It can save you time and effort, and ensure that your documentation is always up-to-date.
