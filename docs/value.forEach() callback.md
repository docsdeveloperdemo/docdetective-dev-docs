## What does this do?

The `httpRequest` method is used to make an HTTP request to a specified URL. It takes a single parameter, which is an object containing the following properties:

* `url`: The URL of the resource to request.
* `method`: The HTTP method to use, such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`.
* `headers`: An object containing the HTTP headers to send with the request.
* `body`: The body of the request, which can be a string, a Buffer, or a stream.

## Why should I use this?

The `httpRequest` method is a convenient way to make HTTP requests from your Node.js code. It handles all of the low-level details of making an HTTP request, such as setting up the connection, sending the request, and receiving the response.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the `httpRequest` method, you must install the `request` module. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install request
```

## How to use this

To use the `httpRequest` method, simply import the `request` module and then call the `httpRequest` method with the appropriate parameters. For example, the following code makes a GET request to the Google homepage:

```
const request = require('request');

request.httpRequest({
  url: 'https://www.google.com',
  method: 'GET',
}, (error, response, body) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log(body);
  }
});
```

The `httpRequest` method returns a Promise, which you can use to handle the response. The Promise will resolve with the response body if the request is successful, or it will reject with an error if the request fails.
