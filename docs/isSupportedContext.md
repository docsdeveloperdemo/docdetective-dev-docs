## What does this do?

The `isSupportedContext` function checks if a given context is supported by the application. It does this by checking the following:

* **Apps:** The function checks if the context's app name and path are included in the list of supported apps.
* **Path:** The function checks if the context's app path exists on the filesystem.
* **Platform:** The function checks if the context's platform is included in the list of supported platforms.

## Why should I use this?

The `isSupportedContext` function can be used to ensure that the application only runs in supported contexts. This can help to prevent errors and crashes.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using the `isSupportedContext` function.

## How to use this

To use the `isSupportedContext` function, you must provide the following arguments:

* **context:** The context to check.
* **apps:** A list of supported apps.
* **platform:** The platform to check.

The function will return `true` if the context is supported, and `false` if it is not.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `isSupportedContext` function:

```javascript
const context = {
  app: {
    name: 'MyApp',
    path: '/path/to/myapp'
  },
  platforms: ['linux', 'windows']
};

const apps = [
  {
    name: 'MyApp',
    path: '/path/to/myapp'
  }
];

const platform = 'linux';

const isSupported = isSupportedContext(context, apps, platform);

if (isSupported) {
  // The context is supported.
} else {
  // The context is not supported.
}
```
