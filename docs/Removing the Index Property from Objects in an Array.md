## What does this do?

The `steps.forEach((step) => delete step.index);` code removes the `index` property from each object in the `steps` array. This can be useful if you want to remove unnecessary data from your objects or if you want to prevent the `index` property from being used in some way.

## Why should I use this?

There are a few reasons why you might want to use the `steps.forEach((step) => delete step.index);` code:

* To remove unnecessary data from your objects. The `index` property is often not needed and can take up unnecessary space in your objects. By removing it, you can make your objects more efficient and easier to work with.
* To prevent the `index` property from being used in some way. The `index` property can be used in a variety of ways, such as to sort an array or to access a specific element in an array. By removing the `index` property, you can prevent it from being used in these ways and ensure that your code behaves as expected.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using the `steps.forEach((step) => delete step.index);` code.

## How to use this

To use the `steps.forEach((step) => delete step.index);` code, simply add it to your code where you want to remove the `index` property from each object in an array. For example:

```javascript
const steps = [
  { index: 0, name: 'Step 1' },
  { index: 1, name: 'Step 2' },
  { index: 2, name: 'Step 3' }
];

steps.forEach((step) => delete step.index);

console.log(steps);
// Output:
// [
//   { name: 'Step 1' },
//   { name: 'Step 2' },
//   { name: 'Step 3' }
// ]
```

## Conclusion

The `steps.forEach((step) => delete step.index);` code is a simple but useful way to remove the `index` property from each object in an array.
