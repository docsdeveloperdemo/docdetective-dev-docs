## What does this do?

The `getLineFromFile` function takes a file path and a line number as arguments and returns the line of text at that line number in the file.

## Why should I use this?

The `getLineFromFile` function can be used to read a specific line of text from a file without having to read the entire file into memory. This can be useful for large files or when you only need to read a small amount of data from a file.

## Prerequisites

The `getLineFromFile` function requires the `fs` module to be installed.

## How to use this

To use the `getLineFromFile` function, you can import the `fs` module and then call the `getLineFromFile` function with the file path and line number as arguments. For example:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const line = getLineFromFile('/path/to/file.txt', 10);
```

The `line` variable will now contain the line of text at line number 10 in the file `/path/to/file.txt`.

## Additional notes

The `getLineFromFile` function can also be used to read a range of lines from a file. To do this, you can pass an array of line numbers as the second argument to the function. For example:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const lines = getLineFromFile('/path/to/file.txt', [10, 11, 12]);
```

The `lines` variable will now contain an array of the lines of text at line numbers 10, 11, and 12 in the file `/path/to/file.txt`.
