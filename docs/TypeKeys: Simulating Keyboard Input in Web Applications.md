## What does this do?

The `typeKeys` function is used to convert a string of keys into a series of key events. This is useful for testing keyboard input, or for simulating user input in a web application.

## Why should I use this?

The `typeKeys` function can be used to test the behavior of a web application when a user presses a key. This can be useful for debugging purposes, or for ensuring that the application behaves as expected.

## Prerequisites

In order to use the `typeKeys` function, you will need to include the following script in your web application:

```html
<script src="typeKeys.js"></script>
```

## How to use this

To use the `typeKeys` function, simply call the function and pass in the string of keys that you want to type. For example, the following code will type the word "hello" into a text input field:

```javascript
typeKeys("hello");
```

The `typeKeys` function will automatically generate the appropriate key events for each key in the string. For example, the following code will generate the following key events:

```
keydown: { key: "h" }
keyup: { key: "h" }
keydown: { key: "e" }
keyup: { key: "e" }
keydown: { key: "l" }
keyup: { key: "l" }
keydown: { key: "l" }
keyup: { key: "l" }
keydown: { key: "o" }
keyup: { key: "o" }
```

The `typeKeys` function can also be used to type special keys, such as the arrow keys or the function keys. To type a special key, simply use the `$` character followed by the name of the key. For example, the following code will type the left arrow key:

```javascript
typeKeys("$Left$");
```

The `typeKeys` function is a powerful tool that can be used to test the behavior of a web application when a user presses a key. This can be useful for debugging purposes, or for ensuring that the application behaves as expected.
