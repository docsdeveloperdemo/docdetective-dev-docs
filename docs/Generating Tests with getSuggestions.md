## What does this do?

The `getSuggestions` function generates a set of suggested tests based on the markup coverage of a set of files. It iterates over the files, identifies uncovered matches, and prompts the user to specify the intent of each match. Based on the intent, it builds appropriate actions and adds them to a test specification. The resulting test specification can then be used to generate a set of tests that cover the uncovered parts of the markup.

## Why should I use this?

The `getSuggestions` function can be useful for quickly generating a set of tests that cover areas of a codebase that are not currently covered by tests. This can help to improve the overall test coverage of a project and reduce the risk of bugs.

## Prerequisites

To use the `getSuggestions` function, you will need to have the following:

* A set of files that you want to generate tests for.
* A markup coverage report for the files.
* A configuration object that specifies the options for the test generation.

## How to use this

To use the `getSuggestions` function, follow these steps:

1. Import the `getSuggestions` function into your code.
2. Create a configuration object that specifies the options for the test generation.
3. Call the `getSuggestions` function with the configuration object and the markup coverage report.
4. The function will return a test specification that can be used to generate a set of tests.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `getSuggestions` function to generate a set of tests for a set of files:

```javascript
const getSuggestions = require('./get-suggestions');

// Create a configuration object
const config = {
  // Specify the options for the test generation
};

// Get the markup coverage report
const markupCoverage = getMarkupCoverage();

// Call the getSuggestions function
const spec = getSuggestions(config, markupCoverage);

// Use the test specification to generate a set of tests
```
