## What does this do?
This code defines a function that takes a list of matches and converts them into a list of steps for use in a testing framework. Each step represents an action to be performed, such as finding an element on the page, going to a URL, typing keys, or saving a screenshot. The function also adds additional information to each step, such as the selector for finding an element or the URL to visit.

## Why should I use this?
This code is useful for creating automated tests for web applications. It allows you to easily define a series of actions to be performed, and then execute those actions in a repeatable way. This can save time and effort when testing web applications, and can help to ensure that the applications are functioning as expected.

## Prerequisites
To use this code, you will need to have a basic understanding of JavaScript and the testing framework that you are using. You will also need to have access to the web application that you want to test.

## How to use this
To use this code, you will need to import it into your testing framework and then call the `matchesToSteps` function. The function will take a list of matches as input and return a list of steps. You can then use the steps to create automated tests for your web application.

Here is an example of how to use the code:

```javascript
import { matchesToSteps } from './utils.js';

const matches = ['aria/button', 'https://www.example.com', 'Hello, world!'];

const steps = matchesToSteps(matches);

console.log(steps);
```

The output of the code will be a list of steps, each of which represents an action to be performed. For example, the first step will be to find an element on the page with the selector `aria/button`. The second step will be to go to the URL `https://www.example.com`. The third step will be to type the keys `Hello, world!` into a text input field.

You can then use the steps to create automated tests for your web application. For example, you could use the steps to test that the button is visible on the page, that the URL loads correctly, and that the text input field accepts the keys that you type.
