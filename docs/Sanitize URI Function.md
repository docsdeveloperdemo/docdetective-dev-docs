## What does this do?

The `sanitizeUri` function takes a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) as input and returns a sanitized version of the URI. The sanitization process involves the following steps:

1. Trimming any leading or trailing whitespace from the URI.
2. If the URI does not include a protocol (e.g., "http://" or "https://"), the function adds the "https://" protocol to the beginning of the URI.

## Why should I use this?

The `sanitizeUri` function is useful for ensuring that URIs are in a consistent and valid format. This can be important for various reasons, such as:

- Ensuring that URIs are properly formatted for use in web browsers or other applications.
- Preventing potential security vulnerabilities caused by malformed URIs.
- Facilitating the parsing and processing of URIs.

## Prerequisites

There are no specific prerequisites for using the `sanitizeUri` function. However, it is generally recommended to use this function whenever working with URIs to ensure their validity and consistency.

## How to use this

To use the `sanitizeUri` function, simply pass the URI you want to sanitize as the input parameter. The function will return the sanitized version of the URI.

Here is an example of how to use the `sanitizeUri` function:

```javascript
const uri = "www.example.com";
const sanitizedUri = sanitizeUri(uri);
console.log(sanitizedUri); // Output: https://www.example.com
```

## Conclusion

The `sanitizeUri` function is a useful tool for ensuring that URIs are in a consistent and valid format. This can be important for various reasons, such as ensuring proper formatting, preventing security vulnerabilities, and facilitating the parsing and processing of URIs.
