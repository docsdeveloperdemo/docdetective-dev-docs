## What does this do?

The `setEnvs` function is used to set environment variables from a specified `.env` file. It checks if the provided file exists, and if it does, it loads the environment variables from that file, overriding any existing environment variables with the same name.

## Why should I use this?

Using the `setEnvs` function can be useful for managing environment variables in your application. It allows you to easily load environment variables from a separate file, which can be helpful for keeping your code clean and organized. Additionally, it allows you to easily override environment variables for testing or development purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `setEnvs` function, you must have a `.env` file in your project. This file should contain your environment variables in the following format:

```
KEY=VALUE
```

For example, a `.env` file might look like this:

```
PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

## How to use this

To use the `setEnvs` function, simply call it with the path to your `.env` file as the argument. For example:

```javascript
const { status, description } = setEnvs('.env');
```

The `setEnvs` function will return an object with two properties: `status` and `description`. The `status` property will be either "PASS" or "FAIL", indicating whether the environment variables were successfully loaded. The `description` property will contain a message describing the result of the operation.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `setEnvs` function to load environment variables from a `.env` file:

```javascript
const { status, description } = setEnvs('.env');

if (status === 'PASS') {
  console.log('Environment variables loaded successfully.');
} else {
  console.error('Error loading environment variables:', description);
}
```
