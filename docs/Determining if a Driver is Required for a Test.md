## What does this do?

The `isDriverRequired` function determines whether a driver is required for a given test. It takes two parameters:

* `appiumRequired`: A boolean value indicating whether Appium is required for the test.
* `test`: A test object that contains information about the test, such as its contexts and steps.

The function first checks if Appium is required for the test. If it is, it then checks if the test has any contexts or steps that require a driver. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

## Why should I use this?

The `isDriverRequired` function can be used to determine whether a driver is required for a given test. This can be useful for optimizing test execution by only starting a driver when it is actually needed.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using the `isDriverRequired` function.

## How to use this

To use the `isDriverRequired` function, simply call it with the following parameters:

* `appiumRequired`: A boolean value indicating whether Appium is required for the test.
* `test`: A test object that contains information about the test, such as its contexts and steps.

The function will return `true` if a driver is required for the test, or `false` otherwise.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `isDriverRequired` function:

```javascript
const isDriverRequired = require('doc-detective-core/src/tests.js');

const test = {
  contexts: ['NATIVE_APP'],
  steps: [
    {
      action: 'click',
      target: 'button',
    },
  ],
};

const appiumRequired = true;

const driverRequired = isDriverRequired(appiumRequired, test);

if (driverRequired) {
  // Start a driver.
}
```

In this example, the `isDriverRequired` function is called with two parameters: `appiumRequired` and `test`. The `appiumRequired` parameter is set to `true`, indicating that Appium is required for the test. The `test` parameter is a test object that contains information about the test, such as its contexts and steps. The `isDriverRequired` function returns `true`, indicating that a driver is required for the test.
