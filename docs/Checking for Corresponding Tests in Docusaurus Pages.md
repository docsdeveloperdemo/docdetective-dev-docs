## What does this do?

The `forEach` method in `analysis.js` iterates over each test in the `spec.tests` array and checks if the `id` property of the test matches the `id` property of the `statementJson` object. If a match is found, the `idMatch` variable is set to `true`.

## Why should I use this?

This code is used to check if a statement has a corresponding test in the test suite. This information can be used to generate documentation or to identify missing tests.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, you must have a `spec.tests` array and a `statementJson` object. The `spec.tests` array should contain an array of test objects, each with an `id` property. The `statementJson` object should have an `id` property that corresponds to the `id` property of a test object in the `spec.tests` array.

## How to use this

To use this code, you can call the `forEach` method on the `spec.tests` array and pass a callback function as an argument. The callback function will be called for each test object in the array. Inside the callback function, you can check if the `id` property of the test object matches the `id` property of the `statementJson` object. If a match is found, you can set the `idMatch` variable to `true`.

Here is an example of how you can use this code:

```javascript
const spec = {
  tests: [
    {
      id: 'test-1',
      name: 'Test 1'
    },
    {
      id: 'test-2',
      name: 'Test 2'
    }
  ]
};

const statementJson = {
  id: 'test-1'
};

spec.tests.forEach((test) => {
  if (test.id && test.id === statementJson.id) {
    idMatch = true;
  }
});

if (idMatch) {
  // The statement has a corresponding test in the test suite.
} else {
  // The statement does not have a corresponding test in the test suite.
}
```
