## What does this do?

The `httpRequest` function makes a request to a URL and returns the response.

## Why should I use this?

The `httpRequest` function is a convenient way to make requests to a URL without having to worry about the details of the request. It can be used to fetch data from a server, submit forms, or upload files.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `httpRequest` function, you must have the following:

* A URL to make the request to.
* A method to use for the request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
* A set of headers to send with the request.
* A body to send with the request (optional).

## How to use this

To use the `httpRequest` function, simply call the function with the following arguments:

* The URL to make the request to.
* The method to use for the request.
* The headers to send with the request.
* The body to send with the request (optional).

The `httpRequest` function will return a promise that resolves to the response from the server. The response will contain the following properties:

* The status code of the response.
* The headers of the response.
* The body of the response.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `httpRequest` function to fetch data from a server:

```javascript
const httpRequest = require('doc-detective-core/src/tests/httpRequest');

const url = 'https://example.com/api/data';
const method = 'GET';
const headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
};

httpRequest(url, method, headers)
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.body);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```
