## What does this do?

The `buildSetVariables` function is used to set environment variables before running a command. It prompts the user to choose whether they want to load environment variables and, if so, provides the option to specify the path to a `.env` file. If the user chooses not to load environment variables, the function sets the `env` variable to `null`.

## Why should I use this?

Using the `buildSetVariables` function can be useful for setting environment variables that are required for a command to run successfully. This can help to ensure that the command has the necessary information to execute properly.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `buildSetVariables` function, you will need to have a `.env` file that contains the environment variables that you want to set. The `.env` file should be located in the same directory as the command that you are running.

## How to use this

To use the `buildSetVariables` function, you can call it with the following parameters:

* `config`: The configuration object for the command.
* `match`: The match object for the command.

The function will then prompt the user to choose whether they want to load environment variables. If the user chooses to load environment variables, the function will read the `.env` file and set the environment variables accordingly. If the user chooses not to load environment variables, the function will set the `env` variable to `null`.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `buildSetVariables` function:

```javascript
const buildSetVariables = require('doc-detective-core/src/suggest');

const config = {
  // Configuration options for the command
};

const match = {
  // Match object for the command
};

const action = buildSetVariables(config, match);

if (action.env) {
  // Set the environment variables
  process.env = {
    ...process.env,
    ...action.env
  };
}

// Run the command
```
