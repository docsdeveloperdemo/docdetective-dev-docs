## What does this do?

The `suggest.js` file in the `doc-detective-core` package contains code that helps developers write documentation for their APIs, code, and SDKs. It provides a way to automatically generate documentation based on the code itself, making it easier for developers to keep their documentation up-to-date.

## Why should I use this?

Using `suggest.js` can save developers time and effort in writing documentation, as it can automatically generate documentation based on the code itself. This can help to ensure that the documentation is accurate and up-to-date, as it is generated directly from the code. Additionally, `suggest.js` can help to improve the quality of the documentation, as it can provide suggestions for how to improve the documentation based on best practices.

## Prerequisites

To use `suggest.js`, you will need to have the following prerequisites:

* Node.js installed on your system
* The `doc-detective-core` package installed

## How to use this

To use `suggest.js`, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the `doc-detective-core` package using npm:

```
npm install doc-detective-core
```

2. Import the `suggest.js` file into your project:

```
const suggest = require('doc-detective-core/src/suggest');
```

3. Call the `suggest()` function with the path to the code file you want to generate documentation for:

```
const documentation = suggest('/path/to/code.js');
```

4. The `suggest()` function will return a string containing the generated documentation. You can then use this documentation to create your own documentation files or to integrate into your existing documentation system.

## Example

The following is an example of how to use `suggest.js` to generate documentation for a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

The `suggest()` function would generate the following documentation for this function:

```
## add()

The `add()` function adds two numbers together.

**Parameters:**

* `a`: The first number to add.
* `b`: The second number to add.

**Returns:**

The sum of the two numbers.

**Example:**

```javascript
const sum = add(1, 2);
console.log(sum); // 3
```
```

## Conclusion

`suggest.js` is a powerful tool that can help developers write documentation for their APIs, code, and SDKs. It can save developers time and effort, and it can help to improve the quality of the documentation.
