## What does this do?

The `suggest` method suggests potential matches for a given query. It takes a query string and a list of documents as input, and returns a list of suggested matches. Each suggested match includes the document title, a snippet of the document text that contains the query string, and a link to the document.

## Why should I use this?

The `suggest` method can be used to improve the user experience by providing users with a list of potential matches for their queries. This can help users to find the information they are looking for more quickly and easily.

## Prerequisites

In order to use the `suggest` method, you must have a list of documents that you want to search. These documents can be in any format, but they must be indexed in order to be searchable.

## How to use this

To use the `suggest` method, you can use the following syntax:

```
suggest(query, documents)
```

The `query` parameter is a string that contains the query that you want to search for. The `documents` parameter is a list of documents that you want to search.

The `suggest` method will return a list of suggested matches. Each suggested match will include the following information:

* The document title
* A snippet of the document text that contains the query string
* A link to the document

You can use the suggested matches to improve the user experience by providing users with a list of potential matches for their queries. This can help users to find the information they are looking for more quickly and easily.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `suggest` method to search for a query in a list of documents:

```
const documents = [
  {
    title: "Document 1",
    text: "This is the first document."
  },
  {
    title: "Document 2",
    text: "This is the second document."
  },
  {
    title: "Document 3",
    text: "This is the third document."
  }
];

const query = "document";

const suggestedMatches = suggest(query, documents);

console.log(suggestedMatches);
```

The output of the above example would be the following:

```
[
  {
    title: "Document 1",
    snippet: "This is the first document.",
    link: "/document-1"
  },
  {
    title: "Document 2",
    snippet: "This is the second document.",
    link: "/document-2"
  },
  {
    title: "Document 3",
    snippet: "This is the third document.",
    link: "/document-3"
  }
]
```
