## What does this do?

The `getDriverCapabilities` function is used to set the capabilities for the Firefox and Chrome browsers. It takes in a configuration object, a browser name, and an options object, and returns a capabilities object.

## Why should I use this?

You should use this function if you want to set the capabilities for the Firefox or Chrome browsers. This is necessary in order to run tests on these browsers.

## Prerequisites

In order to use this function, you must have the following prerequisites:

- A configuration object that contains the following properties:
  - `environment.apps`: An array of objects that represent the applications that are installed on the system. Each object should have a `name` property and a `path` property.
  - `environment.platform`: The platform that the tests are being run on. This can be either "mac" or "windows".
- A browser name, which can be either "firefox" or "chrome".
- An options object that contains the following properties:
  - `width`: The width of the browser window.
  - `height`: The height of the browser window.
  - `headless`: A boolean value that indicates whether or not the browser should be run in headless mode.
  - `path`: The path to the browser executable.

## How to use this

To use this function, simply call it with the configuration object, browser name, and options object as arguments. The function will return a capabilities object that can be used to run tests on the Firefox or Chrome browsers.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```javascript
const config = {
  environment: {
    apps: [
      {
        name: "firefox",
        path: "/Applications/Firefox.app",
      },
      {
        name: "chrome",
        path: "/Applications/Google Chrome.app",
      },
      {
        name: "chromedriver",
        path: "/usr/local/bin/chromedriver",
      },
    ],
    platform: "mac",
  },
};

const browserName = "firefox";

const options = {
  width: 1280,
  height: 800,
  headless: false,
};

const capabilities = getDriverCapabilities(config, browserName, options);

console.log(capabilities);
```

The output of this code will be the following capabilities object:

```json
{
  platformName: "mac",
  "appium:automationName": "Gecko",
  browserName: "MozillaFirefox",
  "moz:firefoxOptions": {
    args: [
      "--width=1280",
      "--height=800",
    ],
    binary: "/Applications/Firefox.app",
  },
}
```

This capabilities object can then be used to run tests on the Firefox browser.
