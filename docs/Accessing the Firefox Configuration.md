## What does this do?

The `firefox` variable is assigned the result of finding the first element in the `config.environment.apps` array that has a `name` property equal to `"firefox"`.

## Why should I use this?

This code is useful for accessing the configuration for the Firefox browser. For example, you could use it to get the path to the Firefox executable or to set Firefox-specific preferences.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this code, you must have the Firefox browser installed on your system.

## How to use this

To use this code, simply import the `config` module and then access the `firefox` variable. For example:

```javascript
const config = require('./config');

const firefox = config.environment.apps.find((app) => app.name === "firefox");
```

You can then use the `firefox` variable to access the Firefox configuration. For example, to get the path to the Firefox executable, you could use the following code:

```javascript
const firefoxPath = firefox.path;
```

To set a Firefox-specific preference, you could use the following code:

```javascript
firefox.preferences.set("browser.startup.homepage", "https://www.google.com");
```
