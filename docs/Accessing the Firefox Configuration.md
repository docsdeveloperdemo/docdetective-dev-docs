## What does this do?

The `firefox` variable is assigned the result of finding the first element in the `config.environment.apps` array that has a `name` property equal to `"firefox"`.

## Why should I use this?

This code is useful for accessing the configuration for the Firefox browser. For example, you could use it to get the path to the Firefox executable or the default profile directory.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this code, you must have the `config` object available. This object is typically created by the `doc-detective-core` library.

## How to use this

To use this code, simply import the `config` object and then access the `firefox` variable. For example:

```javascript
import config from 'doc-detective-core';

const firefox = config.environment.apps.find((app) => app.name === "firefox");
```

You can then use the `firefox` variable to access the configuration for the Firefox browser. For example:

```javascript
const firefoxPath = firefox.path;
const firefoxProfileDirectory = firefox.profileDirectory;
```
