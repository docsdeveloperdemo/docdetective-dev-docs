## What does this do?

The `inContainer` function checks if the current process is running inside a container.

## Why should I use this?

This function can be useful for determining whether or not to use certain features or configurations that may be specific to container environments.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using this function.

## How to use this

To use this function, simply call it without any arguments. It will return a boolean value indicating whether or not the current process is running inside a container.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```javascript
const inContainer = require('doc-detective-core/utils').inContainer;

if (inContainer()) {
  // Do something specific to container environments
} else {
  // Do something specific to non-container environments
}
```

## Additional notes

The `inContainer` function uses a combination of environment variables and system commands to determine whether or not the current process is running inside a container.

On Linux systems, the function checks for the presence of the following environment variables:

* `IN_CONTAINER`
* `CONTAINER_ID`

If either of these environment variables is set, the function assumes that the current process is running inside a container.

On Windows systems, the function checks for the presence of the following environment variable:

* `PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE`

If the value of this environment variable is `x86_64`, the function assumes that the current process is running inside a container.

If none of these environment variables are set, the function uses the `grep` command to check for the presence of the following strings in the `/proc/1/cgroup` file:

* `docker`
* `lxc`
* `kubepods`

If any of these strings are found, the function assumes that the current process is running inside a container.
