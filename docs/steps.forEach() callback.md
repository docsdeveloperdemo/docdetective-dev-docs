## What does this do?

The `forEach` method in `utils.js` iterates over each element in the `steps` array and deletes the `index` property from each element. This is useful for removing unnecessary data from the `steps` array before passing it to another function or method.

## Why should I use this?

You should use this method if you want to remove the `index` property from each element in the `steps` array. This can be useful for reducing the size of the array or for removing unnecessary data before passing it to another function or method.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using this method.

## How to use this

To use this method, simply call the `forEach` method on the `steps` array and pass in a function that deletes the `index` property from each element. For example:

```javascript
steps.forEach((step) => delete step.index);
```

This will remove the `index` property from each element in the `steps` array.

## Additional notes

* The `forEach` method is a built-in method in JavaScript. For more information, see the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach).
* The `delete` operator is used to delete a property from an object. For more information, see the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete).
