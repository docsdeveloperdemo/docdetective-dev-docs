## What does this do?

The `suggestTests` function generates test suggestions for a given configuration. It does this by first running coverage analysis on the code, then using the coverage results to identify areas that need more tests.

## Why should I use this?

The `suggestTests` function can help you to improve the test coverage of your code, which can make it more reliable and easier to maintain. By identifying areas that need more tests, you can focus your testing efforts where they are most needed.

## Prerequisites

To use the `suggestTests` function, you will need to have the following installed:

* Node.js
* The `doc-detective-core` package

## How to use this

To use the `suggestTests` function, simply call it with a configuration object. The configuration object can contain the following properties:

* `code`: The code to be analyzed.
* `coverageThreshold`: The minimum coverage threshold that must be met.
* `ignorePatterns`: An array of patterns to ignore when running coverage analysis.

The `suggestTests` function will return a report of test suggestions. The report will contain the following information:

* The file name of the code that was analyzed.
* The coverage threshold that was used.
* The number of lines of code that were covered.
* The number of lines of code that were not covered.
* A list of test suggestions.

Each test suggestion will contain the following information:

* The line number of the code that needs to be tested.
* The type of test that is needed (e.g., unit test, integration test, etc.).
* A description of the test that needs to be written.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `suggestTests` function:

```javascript
const docDetective = require('doc-detective-core');

const config = {
  code: '// Some code here',
  coverageThreshold: 80,
  ignorePatterns: ['/node_modules/', '/test/']
};

const report = docDetective.suggestTests(config);

console.log(report);
```

The output of the above example will be a report of test suggestions. The report will contain the following information:

* The file name of the code that was analyzed.
* The coverage threshold that was used.
* The number of lines of code that were covered.
* The number of lines of code that were not covered.
* A list of test suggestions.

Each test suggestion will contain the following information:

* The line number of the code that needs to be tested.
* The type of test that is needed (e.g., unit test, integration test, etc.).
* A description of the test that needs to be written.
