## What does this do?

The `setConfig` function is used to set the configuration for the Doc Detective tool. It allows you to specify various options and settings that control how the tool behaves.

## Why should I use this?

Using the `setConfig` function allows you to customize the Doc Detective tool to meet your specific needs. For example, you can specify which input files to process, whether to run tests, and which environment to use.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `setConfig` function, you must first install the Doc Detective tool and have a basic understanding of how it works. You should also be familiar with the configuration options available in the `config.js` file.

## How to use this

To use the `setConfig` function, you simply need to pass it a configuration object. This object can contain any of the following properties:

* `envVariables`: An object containing environment variables to set.
* `input`: An array of input files to process.
* `runTests`: An object containing options for running tests.
* `environment`: The environment to use.

For example, the following code shows how to use the `setConfig` function to set the input files and environment:

```javascript
const config = {
  input: ['path/to/input1.js', 'path/to/input2.js'],
  environment: 'production'
};

setConfig(config);
```

Once you have set the configuration, you can then use the Doc Detective tool to generate documentation for your code.

## Additional notes

* The `setConfig` function can be called multiple times to change the configuration.
* The configuration object is validated to ensure that it is valid. If the configuration is invalid, an error will be logged and the tool will exit.
* The `setConfig` function is asynchronous, so you may need to use `await` when calling it.
