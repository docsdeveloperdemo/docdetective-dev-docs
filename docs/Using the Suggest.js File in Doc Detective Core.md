## What does this do?

The `suggest.js` file is responsible for generating test actions based on the matches found in the code. It iterates through the matches and prompts the user for the intent of each match. Based on the user's input, it builds the appropriate action and adds it to the `test.actions` array.

## Why should I use this?

The `suggest.js` file is a crucial part of the Doc Detective Core library as it helps in generating test actions for the matches found in the code. These test actions are essential for automating the testing of the code and ensuring its reliability.

## Prerequisites

To use the `suggest.js` file, you must have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js installed on your system
- Doc Detective Core library installed

## How to use this

To use the `suggest.js` file, follow these steps:

1. Import the `suggest.js` file into your code.
2. Call the `suggest()` function with the following parameters:
    - `config`: The configuration object for the Doc Detective Core library.
    - `file`: The file object containing the code to be analyzed.
3. The `suggest()` function will generate test actions based on the matches found in the code and add them to the `test.actions` array.

## Example

The following code shows how to use the `suggest.js` file:

```javascript
const suggest = require('doc-detective-core/src/suggest');

const config = {
  // Configuration options
};

const file = {
  // File object containing the code to be analyzed
};

suggest(config, file);
```

This code will generate test actions based on the matches found in the `file` object and add them to the `test.actions` array.

## Additional notes

- The `suggest.js` file uses the `log()` function to log messages to the console. You can set the `logLevel` property in the `config` object to control the level of logging.
- The `suggest.js` file uses the `decideIntent()` function to prompt the user for the intent of each match. You can customize the prompts by overriding the `decideIntent()` function.
