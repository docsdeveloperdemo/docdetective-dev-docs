## What does this do?

The `suggest` function is used to suggest actions to take on a given match. It takes two arguments: `match` and `filepath`. The `match` argument is an object that contains information about the match, including the text of the match, the line number of the match, and the type of match. The `filepath` argument is the path to the file that contains the match.

## Why should I use this?

The `suggest` function can be used to help developers decide what to do with a given match. For example, if a match is found for a deprecated function, the `suggest` function can suggest that the developer replace the function with a newer alternative.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using the `suggest` function.

## How to use this

To use the `suggest` function, simply call the function with the `match` and `filepath` arguments. The function will then print out a list of actions that can be taken on the match. The developer can then choose which action to take.

Here is an example of how to use the `suggest` function:

```
const match = {
  text: 'deprecatedFunction()',
  line: 10,
  type: 'function'
};

const filepath = '/path/to/file.js';

const action = decideIntent(match, filepath);

if (action) {
  // Take the action
}
```

## Relevant method or class

The `suggest` function is part of the `doc-detective-core` library. The library provides a number of tools for helping developers write documentation for their code.

## Placeholders

The following placeholders are used in the documentation:

* Suggest Function: This placeholder should be replaced with the title of the document.
* **{{Method or Class Name}}**: This placeholder should be replaced with the name of the method or class that is being documented.
* **{{Description}}**: This placeholder should be replaced with a description of the method or class.
* **{{Usage}}**: This placeholder should be replaced with instructions on how to use the method or class.
* **{{Examples}}**: This placeholder should be replaced with examples of how to use the method or class.

## Important note

It is important to note that the `suggest` function should only be used to suggest actions that are relevant to the current code and context. The function should not generate any information that does not reflect the current code.
