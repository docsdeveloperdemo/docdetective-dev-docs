## What does this do?

The `checkTestCoverage` function analyzes the test coverage of a set of files. It identifies which lines of code are covered by tests and which are not. This information can be used to improve the quality of the codebase by ensuring that all code is adequately tested.

## Why should I use this?

Test coverage analysis is an important tool for ensuring the quality of a codebase. By identifying which lines of code are not covered by tests, developers can prioritize writing tests for those areas. This can help to prevent bugs from being introduced into the codebase and can also make it easier to debug issues when they do occur.

## Prerequisites

To use the `checkTestCoverage` function, you will need to have the following:

* A set of files to analyze
* A configuration file that specifies the file types to be analyzed and the test coverage criteria to be used

## How to use this

To use the `checkTestCoverage` function, simply call the function with the following arguments:

* `config`: The configuration file
* `files`: The set of files to analyze

The function will return a test coverage report that contains the following information:

* A list of the files that were analyzed
* The number of lines of code that were covered by tests
* The number of lines of code that were not covered by tests
* A list of errors that occurred during the analysis

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `checkTestCoverage` function to analyze the test coverage of a set of files:

```javascript
const config = {
  fileTypes: [
    {
      extensions: [".js"],
      testStartStatementOpen: "describe(",
      testStartStatementClose: ")",
      testIgnoreStatement: "@ignore",
      testEndStatement: "}",
      stepStatementOpen: "it(",
      stepStatementClose: ")",
    },
  ],
};

const files = ["file1.js", "file2.js"];

const testCoverage = checkTestCoverage(config, files);

console.log(testCoverage);
```

The output of the above example will be a test coverage report that contains the following information:

```
{
  files: [
    {
      file: "file1.js",
      coveredLines: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
      uncoveredLines: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
      fileType: {
        extensions: [".js"],
        testStartStatementOpen: "describe(",
        testStartStatementClose: ")",
        testIgnoreStatement: "@ignore",
        testEndStatement: "}",
        stepStatementOpen: "it(",
        stepStatementClose: ")",
      },
    },
    {
      file: "file2.js",
      coveredLines: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
      uncoveredLines: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
      fileType: {
        extensions: [".js"],
        testStartStatementOpen: "describe(",
        testStartStatementClose: ")",
        testIgnoreStatement: "@ignore",
        testEndStatement: "}",
        stepStatementOpen: "it(",
        stepStatementClose: ")",
      },
    },
  ],
  errors: [],
}
```
