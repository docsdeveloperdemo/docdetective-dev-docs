## What does this do?

The `timestamp()` function generates a timestamp in the format `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.

## Why should I use this?

The `timestamp()` function can be used to generate a unique identifier for a file or event. It can also be used to track the time of an event or the last time a file was modified.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using the `timestamp()` function.

## How to use this

To use the `timestamp()` function, simply call the function without any arguments. The function will return a timestamp in the format `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.

For example, the following code will generate a timestamp and store it in the variable `timestamp`:

```javascript
let timestamp = timestamp();
```

The value of the `timestamp` variable will be a string in the format `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.

## Example

The following code shows how to use the `timestamp()` function to generate a unique identifier for a file:

```javascript
let filename = `file-${timestamp()}.txt`;
```

The value of the `filename` variable will be a string in the format `file-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt`. This string can be used as the filename for a new file.
