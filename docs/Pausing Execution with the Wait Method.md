## What does this do?

The `wait` method pauses the execution of the test for a specified duration. This can be useful for waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete, such as a network request or a database query.

## Why should I use this?

The `wait` method can be used to ensure that the test does not continue until a specific condition is met. This can help to prevent the test from failing due to race conditions or other timing issues.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using the `wait` method.

## How to use this

To use the `wait` method, you must provide a duration in milliseconds. The duration can be any positive integer.

The following example shows how to use the `wait` method:

```
const result = await wait(1000);

if (result.status === "PASS") {
  // The wait was successful.
} else {
  // The wait failed.
}
```

## Additional notes

The `wait` method can be used in both synchronous and asynchronous code.

When using the `wait` method in synchronous code, the execution of the test will be paused for the specified duration. This can cause the test to run slowly, so it is important to use the `wait` method only when necessary.

When using the `wait` method in asynchronous code, the execution of the test will not be paused. Instead, the test will continue to execute while the `wait` method is running. This can be useful for waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete without blocking the execution of the test.
