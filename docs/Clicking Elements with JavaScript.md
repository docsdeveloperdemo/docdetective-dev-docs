## What does this do?

The `clickElement` function clicks on a given element. If the click is successful, the function returns a `PASS` status and a description indicating that the element was clicked. If the click fails, the function returns a `FAIL` status and a description indicating that the element could not be clicked.

## Why should I use this?

The `clickElement` function can be used to automate the clicking of elements on a web page. This can be useful for testing purposes or for creating automated tasks.

## Prerequisites

To use the `clickElement` function, you must have a reference to the element that you want to click. This can be obtained by using the `document.querySelector()` or `document.getElementById()` methods.

## How to use this

To use the `clickElement` function, simply pass the element that you want to click as the first argument to the function. The function will then attempt to click on the element and return a `PASS` or `FAIL` status.

Here is an example of how to use the `clickElement` function:

```javascript
const element = document.querySelector('#my-element');

const result = clickElement(element);

if (result.status === 'PASS') {
  // The element was clicked successfully.
} else {
  // The element could not be clicked.
}
```

## Additional notes

The `clickElement` function can also be used to click on elements that are not visible on the screen. To do this, you can use the `scrollIntoView()` method to scroll the element into view before clicking on it.

Here is an example of how to use the `scrollIntoView()` method to click on an element that is not visible on the screen:

```javascript
const element = document.querySelector('#my-element');

element.scrollIntoView();

const result = clickElement(element);

if (result.status === 'PASS') {
  // The element was clicked successfully.
} else {
  // The element could not be clicked.
}
```
