## How to use this

To use the `suggest` function, simply pass a list of suggestions to the function. The function will then return a list of suggestions that are relevant to the current context.

Here is an example of how to use the `suggest` function:

```
const suggestions = [
  'Create a new project',
  'Open an existing project',
  'Import a project from another tool',
  'Learn more about the tool'
];

const relevantSuggestions = suggest(suggestions);

console.log(relevantSuggestions);
