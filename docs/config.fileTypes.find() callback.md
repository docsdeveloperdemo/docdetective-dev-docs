## What does this do?

The `fileType` variable is used to find the file type of a given file extension. This is done by iterating over the `config.fileTypes` array and checking if the extension is included in the `extensions` array of each file type. If a match is found, the file type is returned.

## Why should I use this?

This function is useful for determining the file type of a file so that it can be processed accordingly. For example, a text file can be opened in a text editor, while an image file can be opened in an image viewer.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using this function.

## How to use this

To use this function, simply pass the file extension as an argument. The function will return the file type if a match is found, or `null` if no match is found.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```
const fileType = getFileExtension('txt');

if (fileType) {
  // Open the file in a text editor
} else {
  // The file type is not supported
}
```
