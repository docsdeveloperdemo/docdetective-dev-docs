## What does this do?

The `fileType` variable is used to detect the file type of a given file. This is done by checking if the file extension matches any of the extensions specified in the `config.fileTypes` array. If a match is found, the corresponding file type object is returned.

## Why should I use this?

File type detection is useful for a variety of purposes, such as:

* Determining how to process a file
* Displaying the correct icon for a file
* Providing information about a file

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using this code.

## How to use this

To use this code, simply pass the file extension to the `fileType` variable. The function will then return the corresponding file type object, or `null` if no match is found.

Here is an example of how to use this code:

```javascript
const fileType = config.fileTypes.find((fileType) =>
  fileType.extensions.includes(extension)
);

if (fileType) {
  // Do something with the file type
} else {
  // No matching file type found
}
```
