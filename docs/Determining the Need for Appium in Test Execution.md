## What does this do?

The `isAppiumRequired` function determines whether the Appium driver is required for executing a set of test specifications. It iterates through the provided specifications, checking for the presence of contexts at the spec or test level, and the inclusion of specific actions that require a driver. If any of these conditions are met, the function returns `true`, indicating that Appium is necessary for running the tests.

## Why should I use this?

The `isAppiumRequired` function is useful for determining the appropriate test execution environment. If your test suite includes actions that require a driver, such as interacting with native mobile elements or accessing device-specific features, you must use Appium. By using this function, you can ensure that your tests are executed in the correct environment, avoiding potential errors or unexpected behavior.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `isAppiumRequired` function, you must have the following prerequisites in place:

- A set of test specifications that define the tests to be executed.
- An understanding of the actions that require a driver, such as interacting with native mobile elements or accessing device-specific features.

## How to use this

To use the `isAppiumRequired` function, follow these steps:

1. Import the function into your test script.
2. Call the function with the test specifications as the argument.
3. Check the return value of the function to determine whether Appium is required for executing the tests.

Here is an example of how to use the `isAppiumRequired` function:

```javascript
const { isAppiumRequired } = require('doc-detective-core');

const specs = [
  {
    contexts: ['NATIVE_APP'],
    tests: [
      {
        contexts: ['WEBVIEW'],
        tests: [
          {
            steps: [
              {
                action: 'click',
                target: 'button',
              },
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
];

const appiumRequired = isAppiumRequired(specs);

if (appiumRequired) {
  // Execute tests using Appium
} else {
  // Execute tests without Appium
}
```

In this example, the `isAppiumRequired` function is called with a set of test specifications that include contexts and actions that require a driver. The function returns `true`, indicating that Appium is required for executing the tests.
