## What does this do?

The `typeKeys` function takes a string of keys and replaces any special keys with their corresponding values. This is useful for sending keystrokes to a web application or other software that expects a specific format for key input.

## Why should I use this?

The `typeKeys` function can be used to automate tasks that require sending keystrokes to a software application. For example, you could use it to:

* Fill out forms
* Enter data into spreadsheets
* Send commands to a terminal
* Play games

## Prerequisites

To use the `typeKeys` function, you will need to install the `doc-detective-core` package. You can do this by running the following command:

```
npm install doc-detective-core
```

## How to use this

To use the `typeKeys` function, simply import it into your JavaScript file and call it with the following arguments:

* `keys`: A string of keys to be typed.
* `specialKeyMap`: An object that maps special keys to their corresponding values.

The following example shows how to use the `typeKeys` function to fill out a form:

```javascript
const typeKeys = require('doc-detective-core').typeKeys;

const specialKeyMap = {
  '$ENTER$': '\n',
  '$TAB$': '\t',
  '$BACKSPACE$': '\b',
};

const keys = '$ENTER$Hello, world!$TAB$This is a test.$ENTER$';

typeKeys(keys, specialKeyMap);
```

This code will type the following text into a form:

```
Hello, world!	This is a test.
```

## Conclusion

The `typeKeys` function is a powerful tool that can be used to automate tasks that require sending keystrokes to a software application. It is easy to use and can save you a lot of time and effort.
