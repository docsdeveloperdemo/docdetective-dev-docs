## What does this do?

The `runSpecs` function is the entry point for running a set of test specifications (`specs`) in the Doc Detective framework. It takes a configuration object (`config`) and a list of specs as input, and returns a report summarizing the results of the test run.

## Why should I use this?

The `runSpecs` function provides a convenient way to execute a set of test specifications and generate a report of the results. This can be useful for automating testing of documentation, ensuring that it is accurate and up-to-date.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `runSpecs` function, you must have the following prerequisites in place:

* A set of test specifications written in the Doc Detective format.
* A configuration object that specifies the environment in which the tests should be run.
* A Node.js environment with the Doc Detective framework installed.

## How to use this

To use the `runSpecs` function, follow these steps:

1. Import the `runSpecs` function from the Doc Detective framework.
2. Create a configuration object that specifies the environment in which the tests should be run.
3. Create a list of test specifications written in the Doc Detective format.
4. Call the `runSpecs` function with the configuration object and list of specs as arguments.
5. The function will execute the tests and generate a report of the results.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `runSpecs` function to run a set of test specifications:

```javascript
const { runSpecs } = require('doc-detective');

const config = {
  environment: {
    platform: 'windows',
    apps: [
      {
        name: 'app1',
        path: '/path/to/app1',
      },
      {
        name: 'app2',
        path: '/path/to/app2',
      },
    ],
  },
};

const specs = [
  {
    id: 'spec1',
    description: 'Test specification 1',
    tests: [
      {
        id: 'test1',
        description: 'Test 1',
        steps: [
          {
            id: 'step1',
            description: 'Step 1',
            action: 'Click on the "Button1" button',
          },
          {
            id: 'step2',
            description: 'Step 2',
            action: 'Verify that the "Text1" text is displayed',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
];

const report = runSpecs(config, specs);

console.log(report);
```

The output of the `runSpecs` function will be a report object that summarizes the results of the test run. The report object will contain the following properties:

* `summary`: A summary of the test results, including the number of tests that passed, failed, warned, and skipped.
* `specs`: A list of spec reports, each of which contains the results of the tests in that spec.
* `tests`: A list of test reports, each of which contains the results of the steps in that test.
* `contexts`: A list of context reports, each of which contains the results of the steps in that context.
* `steps`: A list of step reports, each of which contains the result of a single step.

The report object can be used to generate a report of the test results, or to analyze the results and identify any issues with the documentation.
