## What does this do?

The `buildSetVariables` function prompts the user to specify whether they want to load environment variables before running a command. If the user chooses to load environment variables, the function prompts for the path to the `.env` file. The function then returns an action object that can be used to set the environment variables.

## Why should I use this?

The `buildSetVariables` function can be used to load environment variables before running a command. This can be useful if the command requires access to environment variables, such as API keys or database credentials.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `buildSetVariables` function, you must have a `.env` file that contains the environment variables that you want to load.

## How to use this

To use the `buildSetVariables` function, call the function and pass in the configuration object and the match object. The function will then prompt the user to specify whether they want to load environment variables. If the user chooses to load environment variables, the function will prompt for the path to the `.env` file. The function will then return an action object that can be used to set the environment variables.

Here is an example of how to use the `buildSetVariables` function:

```javascript
const config = {
  env: '.env',
};

const match = {
  command: 'run-command',
};

const action = buildSetVariables(config, match);

if (action) {
  // Set the environment variables.
}
```

## Additional notes

* The `buildSetVariables` function will only load environment variables if the user chooses to do so.
* The `buildSetVariables` function will not overwrite any existing environment variables.
* The `buildSetVariables` function will not load environment variables from a file that is not a `.env` file.
