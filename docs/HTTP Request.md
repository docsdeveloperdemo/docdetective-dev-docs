## What does this do?

The `httpRequest` method in `doc-detective-core` is used to make an HTTP request to a given URL. It can be used to fetch data from a remote server, or to send data to a remote server.

## Why should I use this?

The `httpRequest` method is a convenient way to make HTTP requests from your Node.js code. It handles all of the low-level details of making an HTTP request, such as setting up the request headers and sending the request body.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the `httpRequest` method, you must install the `doc-detective-core` package. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```

## How to use this

To use the `httpRequest` method, you must first create an instance of the `DocDetective` class. You can do this by calling the `new DocDetective()` constructor.

* `url`: The URL of the HTTP request.
* `options`: An object containing the options for the HTTP request.

The following code sample shows you how to use the `httpRequest` method to make an HTTP request to a remote server:

```javascript
const docDetective = new DocDetective();

docDetective.httpRequest('https://www.example.com', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 30,
  }),
})
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.body);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

## Conclusion
