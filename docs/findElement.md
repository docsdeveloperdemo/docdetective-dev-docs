## What does this do?

The `findElement` function finds an element matching the given selector and performs various actions on it, such as moving to it, clicking it, typing keys, and matching text.

## Why should I use this?

Use this function to interact with elements on a web page in a reliable and consistent way. It handles common tasks such as waiting for elements to load, clicking buttons, and entering text into fields.

## Prerequisites

Before using this function, you must:

1. Import the `findElement` function from the `doc-detective-core` library.
2. Create a `WebDriver` instance.

## How to use this

To use this function, call it with the following parameters:

* `config`: A configuration object that contains the following properties:
    * `timeout`: The maximum amount of time to wait for an element to load.
    * `moveToOffset`: The offset to use when moving to an element.
* `step`: A step object that contains the following properties:
    * `selector`: The CSS selector of the element to find.
    * `matchText`: The text to match against the element's text.
    * `moveTo`: A boolean value that indicates whether to move to the element.
    * `click`: A boolean value that indicates whether to click the element.
    * `typeKeys`: A string or array of strings representing the keys to type into the element.
* `driver`: A `WebDriver` instance.

The function will return a result object with the following properties:

* `status`: A string indicating the status of the operation.
* `description`: A string describing the operation that was performed.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `findElement` function to find an element and click it:

```javascript
const {findElement} = require('doc-detective-core');

const config = {
  timeout: 10000,
  moveToOffset: {x: 0, y: 0},
};

const step = {
  selector: '#my-button',
  matchText: 'Click Me',
  moveTo: true,
  click: true,
};

const driver = new WebDriver();

const result = findElement(config, step, driver);

if (result.status === 'PASS') {
  console.log('The element was found and clicked.');
} else {
  console.log('The element was not found or could not be clicked.');
}
```
