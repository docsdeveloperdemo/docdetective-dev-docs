## What does this do?

The `isObsRequired` function checks if a set of test specifications require the OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) screen recorder to be used.

## Why should I use this?

The `isObsRequired` function can be used to determine if the OBS screen recorder is needed for a set of tests. This can be useful for setting up the necessary recording environment before running the tests.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using the `isObsRequired` function.

## How to use this

To use the `isObsRequired` function, simply pass in a set of test specifications as the argument. The function will return a boolean value indicating whether or not the OBS screen recorder is required.

Here is an example of how to use the `isObsRequired` function:

```javascript
const specs = [
  {
    tests: [
      {
        steps: [
          {
            action: "startRecording"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
];

const obsRequired = isObsRequired(specs);

if (obsRequired) {
  // Set up the OBS screen recorder
}
```

## Additional notes

The `isObsRequired` function only checks for the presence of the `startRecording` action in the test steps. If other actions that require the OBS screen recorder are added to the test steps, the `isObsRequired` function will not detect them.
