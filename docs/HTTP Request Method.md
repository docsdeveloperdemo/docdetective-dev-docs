## What does this do?

The `httpRequest` method is used to make a request to a URL. It can be used to fetch data from a server, or to send data to a server.

## Why should I use this?

The `httpRequest` method is a convenient way to make HTTP requests from your code. It is easy to use and can be used to make a variety of different types of requests.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the `httpRequest` method, you will need to import the `httpRequest` module. You can do this by adding the following line to your code:

```
import { httpRequest } from '@doc-detective-core/src/tests/httpRequest.js';
```

## How to use this

To use the `httpRequest` method, you will need to provide the following information:

* The URL of the request
* The method of the request (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* The headers of the request
* The body of the request

You can then use the `httpRequest` method to make the request. The method will return a promise that resolves to the response from the server.

Here is an example of how to use the `httpRequest` method:

```
const response = await httpRequest({
  url: 'https://example.com',
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'John Doe',
  }),
});

console.log(response);
```

The `response` object will contain the following information:

* The status code of the response
* The headers of the response
* The body of the response

You can use the `response` object to access the data that you need from the server.

## Conclusion

The `httpRequest` method is a convenient way to make HTTP requests from your code. It is easy to use and can be used to make a variety of different types of requests.
