## What does this do?

The `httpRequest` method sends an HTTP request to the specified URL and returns the response.

## Why should I use this?

The `httpRequest` method is useful for making HTTP requests to external APIs or services. It can be used to retrieve data, send data, or perform other operations.

## Prerequisites

To use the `httpRequest` method, you must have a valid API key. You can obtain an API key by creating an account on the Ned platform.

## How to use this

To use the `httpRequest` method, you must first create an instance of the `Ned` class. You can then use the `httpRequest` method to send an HTTP request to the specified URL.

The following code sample shows you how to use the `httpRequest` method:

```javascript
const ned = new Ned();

const response = await ned.httpRequest({
  url: 'https://example.com/api/v1/users',
  method: 'GET',
});

console.log(response);
```

The `httpRequest` method returns a promise that resolves to the HTTP response. The response object contains the following properties:

* `status`: The HTTP status code.
* `headers`: The HTTP headers.
* `body`: The HTTP response body.

You can use the `status`, `headers`, and `body` properties to access the information you need from the HTTP response.

## Example

The following code sample shows you how to use the `httpRequest` method to retrieve data from an external API:

```javascript
const ned = new Ned();

const response = await ned.httpRequest({
  url: 'https://example.com/api/v1/users',
  method: 'GET',
});

const users = response.body.users;

console.log(users);
```

The `httpRequest` method is a powerful tool that can be used to make HTTP requests to external APIs or services. It can be used to retrieve data, send data, or perform other operations.
