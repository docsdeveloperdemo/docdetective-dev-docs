## What does this do?

The `isAppiumRequired` function determines whether the Appium driver is required to execute a set of test specifications. It iterates through the specifications, tests, and steps to check for the presence of certain conditions that indicate the need for Appium.

## Why should I use this?

The `isAppiumRequired` function is useful for determining the appropriate driver to use when executing test specifications. By identifying the need for Appium, you can ensure that the correct driver is used, which can improve the efficiency and reliability of your test execution.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `isAppiumRequired` function, you should have a set of test specifications that define the tests to be executed. These specifications can be in any format, but they should include information about the contexts and actions to be performed during the tests.

## How to use this

To use the `isAppiumRequired` function, you can import it into your test code and call it with the test specifications as an argument. The function will return a boolean value indicating whether Appium is required to execute the specifications.

Here is an example of how to use the `isAppiumRequired` function:

```javascript
import { isAppiumRequired } from 'doc-detective-core';

const specs = [
  {
    contexts: ['NATIVE_APP'],
    tests: [
      {
        contexts: ['WEBVIEW'],
        steps: [
          { action: 'click' },
          { action: 'type' },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
];

const appiumRequired = isAppiumRequired(specs);

if (appiumRequired) {
  // Use the Appium driver to execute the test specifications.
} else {
  // Use the WebDriver driver to execute the test specifications.
}
```

## Additional notes

The `isAppiumRequired` function is a helper function that can be used to simplify the process of determining the appropriate driver to use for test execution. However, it is important to note that the function is not exhaustive and there may be other factors that need to be considered when making this decision.
