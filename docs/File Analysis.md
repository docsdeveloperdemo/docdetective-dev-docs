## What does this do?

The `analysis.js` file is responsible for analyzing files and extracting relevant information for documentation generation. It supports various file types, including JavaScript, TypeScript, and Markdown.

## Why should I use this?

Using this file allows you to easily generate documentation for your code, making it easier for developers to understand and use your APIs, code, and SDKs.

## Prerequisites

To use this file, you must have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js installed on your system
- The `doc-detective-core` package installed

## How to use this

To use this file, follow these steps:

1. Import the `analysis.js` file into your project.
2. Call the `analyzeFile()` function, passing in the path to the file you want to analyze.
3. The function will return an object containing the extracted information from the file.
4. Use the extracted information to generate documentation for your code.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `analysis.js` file to analyze a JavaScript file:

```javascript
const analysis = require('doc-detective-core/analysis');

const filePath = '/path/to/file.js';

const analysisResult = analysis.analyzeFile(filePath);

console.log(analysisResult);
```

The `analysisResult` object will contain the following information:

- `fileType`: The type of file that was analyzed.
- `extension`: The extension of the file.
- `content`: The contents of the file.
- `methods`: A list of methods defined in the file.
- `classes`: A list of classes defined in the file.
- `imports`: A list of imports used in the file.
- `exports`: A list of exports used in the file.

You can use this information to generate documentation for your code. For example, you could use the `methods` and `classes` lists to generate a list of all the methods and classes defined in your code, and you could use the `imports` and `exports` lists to generate a list of all the dependencies used in your code.
