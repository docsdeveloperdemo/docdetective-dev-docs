## What does this do?

The `httpRequest.js` file contains a function that makes an HTTP request to a given URL. The function takes a URL and an optional options object as arguments. The options object can contain the following properties:

* `method`: The HTTP method to use, such as "GET", "POST", "PUT", or "DELETE".
* `headers`: An object containing the HTTP headers to send with the request.
* `body`: The body of the request, which can be a string, a Buffer, or a stream.
* `timeout`: The maximum amount of time to wait for the request to complete, in milliseconds.

## Why should I use this?

The `httpRequest` function can be used to make HTTP requests from your Node.js applications. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as:

* Fetching data from a web API
* Posting data to a web service
* Updating a resource on a web server
* Deleting a resource from a web server

## Prerequisites

To use the `httpRequest` function, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download Node.js from the Node.js website.

## How to use this

To use the `httpRequest` function, simply import it into your Node.js application and call it with the appropriate arguments. For example, the following code makes a GET request to the Google homepage:

```javascript
const httpRequest = require('./httpRequest');

httpRequest('https://www.google.com', (error, response, body) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log(body);
  }
});
```

The `httpRequest` function returns a Promise, so you can also use it with async/await. For example, the following code does the same thing as the previous example, but uses async/await:

```javascript
const httpRequest = require('./httpRequest');

async function main() {
  try {
    const response = await httpRequest('https://www.google.com');
    console.log(response.body);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

main();
```

## Conclusion

The `httpRequest` function is a versatile tool that can be used to make HTTP requests from your Node.js applications. It is easy to use and can be used for a variety of purposes.
