## What does this do?

The `loadEnvsForString` function replaces environment variables in a string with their corresponding values. This is useful for dynamically generating strings that contain environment-specific information.

## Why should I use this?

You should use the `loadEnvsForString` function if you need to dynamically generate strings that contain environment-specific information. This can be useful for generating configuration files, log messages, or other dynamic content.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the `loadEnvsForString` function, you must have the following prerequisites:

* Node.js installed on your system
* The `process` object must be available in your environment

## How to use this

To use the `loadEnvsForString` function, simply pass the string that you want to replace environment variables in as the first argument. The function will then return a new string with all environment variables replaced with their corresponding values.

Here is an example of how to use the `loadEnvsForString` function:

```javascript
const string = '$HOME/my-project';
const newString = loadEnvsForString(string);
console.log(newString); // '/Users/andrewvanbeek/my-project'
```

## Gotchas

* The `loadEnvsForString` function only replaces environment variables that are defined in the current environment. If an environment variable is not defined, the function will leave it as-is.
* The `loadEnvsForString` function does not recursively replace environment variables. This means that if an environment variable contains another environment variable, the function will not replace the nested environment variable.
* The `loadEnvsForString` function does not support nested environment variables. This means that if an environment variable contains another environment variable, the function will not replace the nested environment variable.
