## What does this do?

The `setVariables` method sets environment variables for the current process.

## Why should I use this?

This method can be used to set environment variables for the current process. This can be useful for setting up the environment for a particular task or for debugging purposes.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using this method.

## How to use this

To use this method, you must provide a path to the environment variables file. The environment variables file is a text file that contains a list of environment variables and their values. Each environment variable is on a separate line, and the variable name and value are separated by an equals sign (=).

For example, the following environment variables file sets the `FOO` environment variable to the value `bar`:

```
FOO=bar
```

Once you have created the environment variables file, you can use the `setVariables` method to set the environment variables for the current process. The following code shows how to use the `setVariables` method:

```
const setVariables = require('doc-detective-core/src/tests/setVariables');

setVariables('/path/to/environment_variables.txt');
```

After the `setVariables` method has been called, the environment variables will be set for the current process. You can verify that the environment variables have been set by using the `printenv` command. The following command will print the value of the `FOO` environment variable:

```
printenv FOO
```

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `setVariables` method to set the environment variables for the current process:

```
const setVariables = require('doc-detective-core/src/tests/setVariables');

setVariables('/path/to/environment_variables.txt');

console.log(process.env.FOO); // bar
```
