## What does this do?

The `loadEnvsForString` function replaces all environment variables in a string with their corresponding values. This is useful for loading configuration values from environment variables into a string.

## Why should I use this?

Using the `loadEnvsForString` function can help to make your code more portable and easier to maintain. By storing configuration values in environment variables, you can easily change them without having to modify your code.

## Prerequisites

To use the `loadEnvsForString` function, you must have the following:

* A string that contains environment variables.
* Access to the environment variables.

## How to use this

To use the `loadEnvsForString` function, simply pass the string that contains the environment variables as the first argument. The function will then return a new string with all of the environment variables replaced with their corresponding values.

Here is an example of how to use the `loadEnvsForString` function:

```javascript
const string = '$HOME/Documents/my-project';
const newString = loadEnvsForString(string);
console.log(newString); // '/Users/andrewvanbeek/Documents/my-project'
```

## Gotchas

* The `loadEnvsForString` function will only replace environment variables that are in the format `${variable_name}`.
* If an environment variable is not found, the `loadEnvsForString` function will leave it unchanged.
* If an environment variable value contains a nested variable, the `loadEnvsForString` function will recurse to try to resolve it.
* If an environment variable value is an object, the `loadEnvsForString` function will convert it to a string before replacing it.
