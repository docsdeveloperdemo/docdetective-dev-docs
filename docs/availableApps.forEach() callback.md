## What does this do?

The `availableApps.forEach((app) => appList.push(app.name));` code iterates over the `availableApps` array and pushes the name of each app into the `appList` array. This allows you to easily access a list of all the available apps by name.

## Why should I use this?

You should use this code if you want to create a list of all the available apps in your system. This can be useful for displaying a list of apps to users, or for performing operations on all of the apps.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using this code.

## How to use this

To use this code, simply call the `availableApps.forEach((app) => appList.push(app.name));` method. This will create a list of all the available apps in your system and store it in the `appList` array.

## Example

The following code shows you how to use the `availableApps.forEach((app) => appList.push(app.name));` method to create a list of all the available apps in your system:

```
const availableApps = [
  { name: 'App 1' },
  { name: 'App 2' },
  { name: 'App 3' }
];

const appList = [];

availableApps.forEach((app) => appList.push(app.name));

console.log(appList); // ['App 1', 'App 2', 'App 3']
```
