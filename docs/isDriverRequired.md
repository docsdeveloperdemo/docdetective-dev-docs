## What does this do?

The `isDriverRequired` function determines whether a driver is required for a given test. It takes two parameters:

- `appiumRequired`: A boolean value indicating whether Appium is required for the test.
- `test`: A test object that contains information about the test, including its contexts and steps.

The function first checks if Appium is required for the test. If Appium is required, it then checks if the test has any contexts or steps that require a driver. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns `true`, indicating that a driver is required for the test. Otherwise, the function returns `false`, indicating that a driver is not required.

## Why should I use this?

The `isDriverRequired` function can be used to determine whether a driver is required for a given test. This information can be used to optimize the test execution process by only starting a driver when it is actually needed.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `isDriverRequired` function, you must first install the `doc-detective-core` package. You can do this by running the following command:

```
npm install doc-detective-core
```

## How to use this

To use the `isDriverRequired` function, you can import it into your test file and then call it with the appropriate parameters. For example:

```javascript
const { isDriverRequired } = require('doc-detective-core');

const test = {
  contexts: ['NATIVE_APP'],
  steps: [
    {
      action: 'click',
      target: 'button',
    },
  ],
};

const driverRequired = isDriverRequired(true, test);

if (driverRequired) {
  // Start a driver.
}
```

In this example, the `isDriverRequired` function is called with two parameters: `true` (indicating that Appium is required for the test) and `test` (a test object that contains information about the test). The function returns `true`, indicating that a driver is required for the test.
