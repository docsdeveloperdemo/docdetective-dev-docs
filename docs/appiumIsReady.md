## What does this do?

The `appiumIsReady` function checks if the Appium server is ready to receive commands.

## Why should I use this?

You should use this function before sending any commands to the Appium server. If the server is not ready, your commands will fail.

## Prerequisites

You must have the Appium server installed and running.

## How to use this

To use this function, simply call it and wait for it to return `true`. Once the function returns `true`, you can start sending commands to the Appium server.

Here is an example of how to use the `appiumIsReady` function:

```
async function testAppium() {
  // Wait for the Appium server to be ready
  await appiumIsReady();

  // Send a command to the Appium server
  let resp = await axios.get("http://0.0.0.0:4723/sessions");

  // Check the response from the Appium server
  if (resp.status === 200) {
    console.log("Appium server is ready!");
  } else {
    console.log("Appium server is not ready!");
  }
}
```

## Additional notes

The `appiumIsReady` function will retry indefinitely until the Appium server is ready. You can configure the retry delay and timeout duration by passing in optional parameters to the function.

The `appiumIsReady` function is also available as a promise. You can use the promise version of the function by calling `appiumIsReady().then(...)`.
