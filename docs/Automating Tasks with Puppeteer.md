## What does this do?
This code defines a function that takes an array of matches and converts them into an array of steps. Each step represents an action to be performed, such as finding an element, going to a URL, typing keys, or saving a screenshot.

## Why should I use this?
This code is useful for automating tasks that involve interacting with a web browser. For example, you could use it to create a script that logs in to a website, fills out a form, and submits it.

## Prequsites
Before using this code, you will need to install the following dependencies:

```
npm install puppeteer
```

## How to use this
To use this code, you will need to create a new Puppeteer script and import the `utils.js` module. Then, you can call the `matchesToSteps` function with an array of matches as the argument. The function will return an array of steps that you can use to automate your tasks.

Here is an example of how you could use this code:

```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const utils = require('./utils');

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Get the matches from the page
  const matches = await page.$$('a');

  // Convert the matches to steps
  const steps = utils.matchesToSteps(matches);

  // Execute the steps
  for (const step of steps) {
    switch (step.action) {
      case 'find':
        await page.waitForSelector(step.selector);
        break;
      case 'goTo':
      case 'checkLink':
        await page.goto(step.url);
        break;
      case 'typeKeys':
        await page.keyboard.type(step.keys);
        break;
      case 'saveScreenshot':
        await page.screenshot({ path: step.path });
        break;
      default:
        break;
    }
  }

  // Close the browser
  await browser.close();
})();
```

This script will open a new Puppeteer browser window and navigate to the URL specified in the `matches` array. It will then wait for each element in the `matches` array to appear on the page and then perform the corresponding action. For example, if an element is a link, the script will click on it. If an element is a text input field, the script will type the specified text into the field.

## Conclusion
This code provides a simple way to automate tasks that involve interacting with a web browser. By using the `matchesToSteps` function, you can easily convert an array of matches into an array of steps that you can use to automate your tasks.
