## What does this do?
This method checks if the given object matches the given matchObject.

## Why should I use this?
This method is useful for finding objects in an array that match a certain criteria.

## Prequsites
None.

## How to use this
To use this method, you first need to create an object that contains the properties that you want to match. Then, you can call the `find` method on the array that you want to search, and pass in the matchObject as the argument. The `find` method will return the first object in the array that matches the matchObject.

Here is an example of how to use the `find` method:

```
const fruits = [
  { name: 'apple', color: 'red' },
  { name: 'banana', color: 'yellow' },
  { name: 'orange', color: 'orange' }
];

const redFruit = fruits.find(fruit => fruit.color === 'red');

console.log(redFruit); // { name: 'apple', color: 'red' }
```

In this example, the `find` method is used to find the first fruit in the `fruits` array that has the color 'red'. The `find` method returns the object `{ name: 'apple', color: 'red' }`.

## Example
```
const matchObject = {
  line: 10,
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  indexInFile: 100
};

const objects = [
  {
    line: 10,
    text: 'Hello, world!',
    indexInFile: 100
  },
  {
    line: 20,
    text: 'Goodbye, world!',
    indexInFile: 200
  }
];

const foundObject = objects.find(object => {
  return (
    object.line === matchObject.line &&
    object.text === matchObject.text &&
    object.indexInFile === matchObject.indexInFile
  );
});

console.log(foundObject); // { line: 10, text: 'Hello, world!', indexInFile: 100 }
```
