## What does this do?
This code snippet is a part of the analysis module for Doc Detective, a tool that helps developers understand and improve their code documentation. The purpose of this code is to identify and mark lines of code that are covered or uncovered by tests, based on a given regular expression pattern.

## Why should I use this?
This code is useful for ensuring that your code is well-tested and that all important parts of your code are covered by tests. By identifying uncovered lines of code, you can prioritize writing tests for those areas and improve the overall quality of your codebase.

## Prerequisites
To use this code, you will need to have the following:

- A codebase that you want to analyze
- A regular expression pattern that matches the lines of code you want to check for coverage

## How to use this
To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Import the `analysis` module into your code.
2. Create an instance of the `Analysis` class.
3. Call the `markCoverage` method on the `Analysis` instance, passing in the regular expression pattern and the codebase you want to analyze.
4. The `markCoverage` method will return an object containing information about the covered and uncovered lines of code.

## Example
Here is an example of how to use this code:

```javascript
const analysis = require('doc-detective-core/analysis');

const analyzer = new analysis.Analysis();
const coverage = analyzer.markCoverage(/some-regex-pattern/, 'path/to/codebase');

console.log(coverage);
```

The output of the `markCoverage` method will be an object containing the following properties:

- `coveredLines`: An array of line numbers that are covered by tests.
- `uncoveredLines`: An array of line numbers that are not covered by tests.
- `coveredMatches`: An array of objects representing covered matches of the regular expression pattern. Each object contains the line number, index in the file, and text of the match.
- `uncoveredMatches`: An array of objects representing uncovered matches of the regular expression pattern. Each object contains the line number, index in the file, and text of the match.

You can use this information to identify and prioritize areas of your code that need more testing.
