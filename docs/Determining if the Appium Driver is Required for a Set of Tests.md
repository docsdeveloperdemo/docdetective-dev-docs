## What does this do?

This code checks if the Appium driver is required for a given set of tests.

## Why should I use this?

This code can be used to determine if the Appium driver is required for a given set of tests. This can be useful for optimizing test execution by only running the Appium driver when it is necessary.

## Prerequisites

This code requires the following:

* The `appium-required` package
* A set of tests that are being executed

## How to use this

To use this code, you can import the `appium-required` package and then call the `isAppiumRequired` function. This function will take a set of tests as input and return a boolean value indicating whether or not the Appium driver is required.

Here is an example of how to use this code:

```javascript
const appiumRequired = require('appium-required');

const tests = [
  {
    contexts: ['NATIVE_APP'],
    tests: [
      {
        contexts: ['NATIVE_APP'],
        steps: [
          {
            action: 'click',
            target: 'button'
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
];

const isAppiumRequired = appiumRequired(tests);

if (isAppiumRequired) {
  // The Appium driver is required for these tests.
} else {
  // The Appium driver is not required for these tests.
}
```

## Additional notes

* This code only checks for the presence of Appium-specific actions in the test steps. It does not check for other factors that may require the Appium driver, such as the use of Appium-specific capabilities.
* This code is not exhaustive. There may be other cases where the Appium driver is required that are not covered by this code.
