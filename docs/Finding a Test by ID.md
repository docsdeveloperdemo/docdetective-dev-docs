## What does this do?

The `findTestById` method is used to find a test by its ID.

## Why should I use this?

This method is useful for retrieving a specific test from a set of tests. For example, you could use this method to retrieve a test that you want to run or debug.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `findTestById` method, you must first create a `Spec` object. A `Spec` object represents a set of tests. You can create a `Spec` object by calling the `Spec()` constructor.

## How to use this

To use the `findTestById` method, you must first call the `tests` property of the `Spec` object. The `tests` property returns an array of `Test` objects. You can then call the `find()` method of the array to find a test by its ID. The `find()` method takes a callback function as its argument. The callback function should return `true` if the test matches the specified ID.

The following code sample shows you how to use the `findTestById` method:

```javascript
const spec = new Spec();
const test = spec.tests.find((test) => test.id === id);
```

## Output

The `findTestById` method returns a `Test` object. The `Test` object contains the following properties:

* `id`: The ID of the test.
* `name`: The name of the test.
* `description`: The description of the test.
* `steps`: The steps of the test.
* `expectedResults`: The expected results of the test.
