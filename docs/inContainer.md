## What does this do?

The `inContainer` function checks if the current process is running inside a container.

## Why should I use this?

This function can be used to determine if certain operations should be performed differently when running in a container. For example, you might want to use a different logging mechanism or configuration file when running in a container.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using this function.

## How to use this

To use this function, simply call it and check the return value. If the function returns `true`, then the current process is running inside a container. Otherwise, the current process is not running inside a container.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```js
if (inContainer()) {
  // Do something different when running in a container
} else {
  // Do something different when not running in a container
}
```

## Additional notes

The `inContainer` function uses the following methods to determine if the current process is running inside a container:

* Checks the `IN_CONTAINER` environment variable.
* Checks the `/proc/1/cgroup` file for the presence of the words "docker", "lxc", or "kubepods".

If either of these methods returns a positive result, then the function returns `true`. Otherwise, the function returns `false`.
