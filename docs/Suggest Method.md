## What does this do?

The `suggest` method suggests a list of possible completions for a given input string. The completions are generated based on the contents of the provided `corpus` and are ranked by their relevance to the input string.

## Why should I use this?

The `suggest` method can be used to provide auto-complete functionality for text inputs, or to generate a list of possible search results for a given query.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `suggest` method, you must first create a `corpus` object. A corpus is a collection of text documents that will be used to generate the suggestions. The corpus can be created from a variety of sources, such as a text file, a database, or a web page.

## How to use this

To use the `suggest` method, you must first create a `corpus` object. Once you have created a corpus, you can then call the `suggest` method on the corpus object. The `suggest` method takes two parameters:

* `inputString`: The input string for which you want to generate suggestions.
* `options`: An optional object that can be used to specify the maximum number of suggestions to return, the minimum length of the suggestions, and the maximum distance between the input string and the suggestions.

The `suggest` method will return a list of suggestions that are ranked by their relevance to the input string. The suggestions will be returned in an array of objects, where each object contains the following properties:

* `suggestion`: The suggested string.
* `score`: The relevance score of the suggestion.
* `line`: The line number in the corpus where the suggestion was found.
* `indexInFile`: The index of the suggestion in the corpus.

Here is an example of how to use the `suggest` method:

```javascript
const corpus = new Corpus('my-corpus.txt');

const suggestions = corpus.suggest('hello');

console.log(suggestions);
```

The output of the above code will be an array of objects, where each object contains the suggested string, the relevance score of the suggestion, the line number in the corpus where the suggestion was found, and the index of the suggestion in the corpus.

## Example

The following code shows how to use the `suggest` method to provide auto-complete functionality for a text input:

```html
<input type="text" id="input-string">

<ul id="suggestions"></ul>

<script>
  const corpus = new Corpus('my-corpus.txt');

  const inputString = document.getElementById('input-string');
  const suggestions = document.getElementById('suggestions');

  inputString.addEventListener('input', () => {
    const suggestions = corpus.suggest(inputString.value);

    suggestions.innerHTML = '';

    for (const suggestion of suggestions) {
      const li = document.createElement('li');
      li.textContent = suggestion.suggestion;

      suggestions.appendChild(li);
    }
  });
</script>
```

The above code will create a text input and a list of suggestions. When the user types into the text input, the `suggest` method will be called to generate a list of suggestions. The suggestions will then be displayed in the list of suggestions.
