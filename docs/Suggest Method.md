## What does this do?

The `suggest` method is used to suggest a list of possible completions for a given input string. This can be used to help users find the correct method or class to use, or to provide auto-complete functionality in a code editor.

## Why should I use this?

The `suggest` method can be helpful in a number of scenarios. For example, it can be used to:

* Help users find the correct method or class to use.
* Provide auto-complete functionality in a code editor.
* Generate documentation for a method or class.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `suggest` method, you must first create a `DocDetective` instance. You can do this by calling the `DocDetective()` constructor.

## How to use this

To use the `suggest` method, simply call it on a `DocDetective` instance and pass in the input string that you want to suggest completions for. The method will return a list of possible completions.

Here is an example of how to use the `suggest` method:

```javascript
const docDetective = new DocDetective();
const completions = docDetective.suggest('myClass');
```

The `completions` variable will now contain a list of possible completions for the input string `myClass`.

## Conclusion

The `suggest` method is a powerful tool that can be used to help users find the correct method or class to use, or to provide auto-complete functionality in a code editor.
