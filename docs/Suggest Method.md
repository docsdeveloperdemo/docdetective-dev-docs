## What does this do?

The `suggest` method is used to suggest a list of potential matches for a given query. The matches are based on the contents of the provided `index`.

## Why should I use this?

The `suggest` method can be used to provide users with a list of potential matches for a given query. This can be helpful for users who are not sure exactly what they are looking for, or who want to explore different options.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `suggest` method, you must first create an index. This can be done using the `createIndex` method.

## How to use this

To use the `suggest` method, you must first create an instance of the `Suggest` class. This can be done by calling the `Suggest` constructor.

Once you have created an instance of the `Suggest` class, you can call the `suggest` method. The `suggest` method takes two parameters:

* `query`: The query to search for.
* `options`: An optional object that can be used to specify additional options for the search.

The `suggest` method will return a list of potential matches for the given query. The matches will be sorted by relevance, with the most relevant matches appearing first.

Here is an example of how to use the `suggest` method:

```javascript
const suggest = new Suggest(index);

const matches = suggest.suggest('query');

console.log(matches);
```

## Output

The `suggest` method will return a list of potential matches for the given query. The matches will be sorted by relevance, with the most relevant matches appearing first.

Each match will contain the following information:

* `text`: The text of the match.
* `score`: The relevance score of the match.
* `indexInFile`: The index of the match in the file.
* `line`: The line number of the match in the file.

Here is an example of a match:

```json
{
  "text": "Hello, world!",
  "score": 0.9,
  "indexInFile": 10,
  "line": 2
}
```
