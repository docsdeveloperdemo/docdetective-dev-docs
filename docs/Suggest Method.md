## What does this do?

The `suggest` method is used to suggest a list of possible completions for a given input string. This can be useful for providing auto-complete functionality in a text editor or IDE, or for generating suggestions for search queries.

## Why should I use this?

The `suggest` method can be used to improve the user experience by providing helpful suggestions for completing a task. This can save time and effort for the user, and can also help to prevent errors.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `suggest` method, you must first create a `SuggestClient`. This can be done by calling the `SuggestClient.create()` method.

## How to use this

To use the `suggest` method, you must first create a `SuggestRequest` object. This object contains the input string for which you want to generate suggestions. You can then call the `suggest` method on the `SuggestClient` object, passing in the `SuggestRequest` object as an argument. The `suggest` method will return a `SuggestResponse` object, which contains a list of suggested completions.

The following code sample shows you how to use the `suggest` method:

```javascript
const {SuggestClient} = require('@google-cloud/doc-detective');

const client = new SuggestClient();

const request = {
  input: 'Hello, w',
};

client.suggest(request, (err, response) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }

  const suggestions = response.suggestions;

  suggestions.forEach(suggestion => {
    console.log(suggestion.completion);
  });
});
```

## Example

The following code sample shows you how to use the `suggest` method to generate suggestions for a search query:

```javascript
const {SuggestClient} = require('@google-cloud/doc-detective');

const client = new SuggestClient();

const request = {
  input: 'How to',
};

client.suggest(request, (err, response) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }

  const suggestions = response.suggestions;

  suggestions.forEach(suggestion => {
    console.log(suggestion.completion);
  });
});
```

The output of the above code sample would be a list of suggested completions for the search query "How to". For example, the output might include the following suggestions:

* How to write a resume
* How to cook a chicken
* How to change a tire
* How to build a house
* How to invest in stocks
