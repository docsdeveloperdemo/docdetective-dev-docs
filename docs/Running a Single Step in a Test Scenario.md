## What does this do?

The `runStep` function is the main entry point for executing a single step in a test scenario. It takes a configuration object, a step object, and a WebDriver instance as input, and returns an action result object.

## Why should I use this?

The `runStep` function is used to execute a single step in a test scenario. It is a convenient way to encapsulate the logic for executing a step, and it can be used to easily create complex test scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `runStep` function, you must have a configuration object, a step object, and a WebDriver instance. The configuration object should contain the necessary configuration settings for the test scenario, such as the URL of the application under test and the browser to use. The step object should contain the details of the step to be executed, such as the action to perform and the target element. The WebDriver instance is used to interact with the application under test.

## How to use this

To use the `runStep` function, simply call it with the configuration object, the step object, and the WebDriver instance as arguments. The function will execute the step and return an action result object. The action result object will contain the status of the step (either "PASS" or "FAIL") and a description of the result.

Here is an example of how to use the `runStep` function:

```javascript
async function runTest() {
  // Create a configuration object
  const config = {
    url: "https://www.example.com",
    browser: "chrome",
  };

  // Create a step object
  const step = {
    action: "goTo",
    target: "/",
  };

  // Create a WebDriver instance
  const driver = new WebDriver();

  // Execute the step
  const actionResult = await runStep(config, step, driver);

  // Check the status of the step
  if (actionResult.status === "PASS") {
    console.log("Step passed");
  } else {
    console.log("Step failed");
  }
}
```

## Relevant methods and classes

The following methods and classes are relevant to the `runStep` function:

* **Configuration object:** The configuration object contains the necessary configuration settings for the test scenario, such as the URL of the application under test and the browser to use.
* **Step object:** The step object contains the details of the step to be executed, such as the action to perform and the target element.
* **WebDriver instance:** The WebDriver instance is used to interact with the application under test.
* **ActionResult object:** The action result object contains the status of the step (either "PASS" or "FAIL") and a description of the result.
