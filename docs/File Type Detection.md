## What does this do?

The `fileType` variable is used to detect the file type of a given file. This is done by checking if the file extension matches any of the extensions specified in the `config.fileTypes` array. If a match is found, the corresponding file type object is returned.

## Why should I use this?

File type detection is useful for a variety of purposes, such as:

* Determining how to process a file
* Displaying the correct icon for a file
* Providing information about a file

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using this code.

## How to use this

To use this code, simply call the `fileType` function with the file extension as the argument. The function will return the corresponding file type object, or `null` if no match is found.

Here is an example of how to use this code:

```javascript
const fileType = require('file-type');

const fileExtension = 'txt';
const fileTypeObject = fileType(fileExtension);

console.log(fileTypeObject);
```

Output:

```
{
  ext: 'txt',
  mime: 'text/plain'
}
```
