## What does this do?

The `httpRequest` method is used to make an HTTP request to a specified URL. It takes a single argument, which is an object that contains the following properties:

* `url`: The URL of the resource to which the request is being made.
* `method`: The HTTP method to use for the request. This can be one of the following: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`, or `CONNECT`.
* `headers`: An object containing the headers to be sent with the request.
* `body`: The body of the request. This can be a string, a Buffer, or a stream.

## Why should I use this?

The `httpRequest` method is a convenient way to make HTTP requests from your code. It handles all of the low-level details of making the request, such as setting up the connection, sending the request, and receiving the response.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the `httpRequest` method, you must first install the `doc-detective-core` package. You can do this by running the following command:

```
npm install doc-detective-core
```

## How to use this

To use the `httpRequest` method, simply import it from the `doc-detective-core` package and then call it with the appropriate arguments. For example, the following code makes a GET request to the URL `https://www.google.com`:

```
const { httpRequest } = require('doc-detective-core');

httpRequest({
  url: 'https://www.google.com',
  method: 'GET',
});
```

The `httpRequest` method returns a Promise that resolves to the response from the server. The response object contains the following properties:

* `statusCode`: The HTTP status code of the response.
* `headers`: An object containing the headers of the response.
* `body`: The body of the response. This can be a string, a Buffer, or a stream.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `httpRequest` method to make a POST request to the URL `https://www.example.com/api/v1/users`. The request body is a JSON object that contains the user's name and email address.

```
const { httpRequest } = require('doc-detective-core');

httpRequest({
  url: 'https://www.example.com/api/v1/users',
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john.doe@example.com',
  }),
});
```

The `httpRequest` method will return a Promise that resolves to the response from the server. The response object will contain the HTTP status code, the headers, and the body of the response.
