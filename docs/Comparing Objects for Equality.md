## What does this do?

The `object` parameter is compared to the `matchObject` parameter to determine if they are equal. The comparison is based on the following properties:

* `line`: The line number of the object in the file.
* `text`: The text of the object.
* `indexInFile`: The index of the object in the file.

If all three properties are equal, the objects are considered to be equal.

## Why should I use this?

This function can be used to compare two objects to see if they are equal. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as:

* Testing: This function can be used to test whether two objects are equal. This can be helpful for debugging purposes.
* Data validation: This function can be used to validate data to ensure that it is consistent.
* Object comparison: This function can be used to compare two objects to see if they are equal. This can be helpful for a variety of purposes, such as determining whether two objects are the same or different.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using this function.

## How to use this

To use this function, simply pass two objects as arguments. The function will return a boolean value indicating whether the objects are equal.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```javascript
const object1 = {
  line: 1,
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  indexInFile: 0
};

const object2 = {
  line: 1,
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  indexInFile: 0
};

const areEqual = isEqual(object1, object2);

console.log(areEqual); // true
```

## Conclusion

The `isEqual` function is a useful tool for comparing two objects to see if they are equal. This function can be used for a variety of purposes, such as testing, data validation, and object comparison.
