## What does this do?

The `testReport.contexts.find((context) => context.result === "FAIL")` method in `doc-detective-core` checks if any of the contexts in the test report have a result of "FAIL".

## Why should I use this?

This method can be used to determine if any of the tests in a test report have failed. This can be useful for quickly identifying which tests need to be investigated further.

## Prerequisites

Before using this method, you must first create a test report. This can be done by running the `doc-detective` command with the `--report` option.

## How to use this

To use this method, simply call it on a test report object. The method will return a boolean value indicating whether or not any of the contexts in the test report have a result of "FAIL".

Here is an example of how to use this method:

```javascript
const testReport = require('./test-report.json');

if (testReport.contexts.find((context) => context.result === "FAIL")) {
  console.log('One or more tests have failed.');
} else {
  console.log('All tests have passed.');
}
```

## Output

The output of this method is a boolean value indicating whether or not any of the contexts in the test report have a result of "FAIL".
