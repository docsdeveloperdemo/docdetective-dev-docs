## What does this do?

The `isAppiumRequired` function determines whether the Appium driver is required for executing a set of test specifications. It iterates through the provided specifications, checking for the presence of contexts at the spec and test levels, and also examines the test steps for actions that require a driver. If any of these conditions are met, the function returns `true`, indicating that Appium is necessary for running the tests.

## Why should I use this?

The `isAppiumRequired` function is useful for determining the appropriate test execution environment. If the tests require Appium-specific features, such as interacting with mobile contexts or performing driver-based actions, then Appium must be used. Otherwise, the tests can be executed without Appium.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `isAppiumRequired` function, you must have a set of test specifications that define the tests to be executed. These specifications should include information about the contexts and test steps involved in the tests.

## How to use this

To use the `isAppiumRequired` function, pass the test specifications as an argument to the function. The function will return `true` if Appium is required for executing the tests, or `false` otherwise.

Here is an example of how to use the `isAppiumRequired` function:

```javascript
const specs = [
  {
    contexts: ['NATIVE_APP'],
    tests: [
      {
        contexts: ['WEBVIEW'],
        tests: [
          {
            steps: [
              {
                action: 'click',
                target: 'button'
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
];

const appiumRequired = isAppiumRequired(specs);

if (appiumRequired) {
  // Use Appium to execute the tests
} else {
  // Use a non-Appium test execution environment
}
```

In this example, the `isAppiumRequired` function is called with a set of test specifications that include contexts and test steps. The function returns `true`, indicating that Appium is required for executing the tests because the specifications include contexts and driver-based actions.
