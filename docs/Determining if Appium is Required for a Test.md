## What does this do?
This code snippet checks if the test requires Appium by checking if contexts are defined at the test level or if the test includes actions that require a driver.

## Why should I use this?
This is useful for determining if Appium is required for a given test, which can help to reduce the amount of time spent on unnecessary setup and configuration.

## Prerequisites
None

## How to use this
To use this code snippet, you can simply import the `appiumRequired` function and call it with your test object as the argument. The function will return a boolean value indicating whether or not Appium is required for the test.

Here is an example of how you can use this code snippet:

```
import { appiumRequired } from './tests';

const test = {
  contexts: [],
  steps: [
    {
      action: 'click',
      target: 'element',
    },
  ],
};

const isAppiumRequired = appiumRequired(test);

if (isAppiumRequired) {
  // Set up Appium
} else {
  // Do not set up Appium
}
```
