## What does this do?

The `remoteJSON.forEach` method iterates over each spec in the `remoteJSON` array. For each spec, it calls the `forEach` method on the `tests` array, which iterates over each test in the `tests` array. If the `id` property of a test matches the `id` property of the `statementJson` object, the `idMatch` variable is set to `true`.

## Why should I use this?

This code is used to check if a statement is present in a set of tests. This can be useful for ensuring that a statement is tested before it is released into production.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, you must have the following:

* A `remoteJSON` array that contains a list of specs.
* A `statementJson` object that contains the statement to be checked.

## How to use this

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Call the `forEach` method on the `remoteJSON` array.
2. For each spec in the `remoteJSON` array, call the `forEach` method on the `tests` array.
3. For each test in the `tests` array, check if the `id` property of the test matches the `id` property of the `statementJson` object.
4. If the `id` property of a test matches the `id` property of the `statementJson` object, set the `idMatch` variable to `true`.

## Example

The following code shows how to use this code to check if a statement is present in a set of tests:

```javascript
const remoteJSON = [
  {
    tests: [
      {
        id: 'test1',
        name: 'Test 1',
      },
      {
        id: 'test2',
        name: 'Test 2',
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    tests: [
      {
        id: 'test3',
        name: 'Test 3',
      },
      {
        id: 'test4',
        name: 'Test 4',
      },
    ],
  },
];

const statementJson = {
  id: 'test2',
  name: 'Test 2',
};

let idMatch = false;

remoteJSON.forEach((spec) => {
  spec.tests.forEach((test) => {
    if (test.id && test.id === statementJson.id) idMatch = true;
  });
});

if (idMatch) {
  console.log('The statement is present in the set of tests.');
} else {
  console.log('The statement is not present in the set of tests.');
}
```
