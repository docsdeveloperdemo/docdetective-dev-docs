## What does this do?

This code checks if the Appium driver is required for a given test.

## Why should I use this?

This code is useful for determining if the Appium driver is required for a given test. This can be helpful for optimizing test execution by only running the Appium driver when necessary.

## Prerequisites

None.

## How to use this

To use this code, you can call the `appiumRequired` function with a list of test specifications. The function will return a boolean value indicating whether or not the Appium driver is required for any of the tests.

Here is an example of how to use the `appiumRequired` function:

```javascript
const appiumRequired = require('doc-detective-core/tests');

const specs = [
  {
    contexts: [],
    tests: [
      {
        contexts: [],
        steps: [
          {
            action: 'click',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
];

const isAppiumRequired = appiumRequired(specs);

if (isAppiumRequired) {
  // The Appium driver is required for at least one of the tests.
} else {
  // The Appium driver is not required for any of the tests.
}
```
