## What does this do?

The `setConfig` function is used to set the configuration for the Doc Detective tool. It takes a configuration object as input and validates it, then standardizes the value formats and detects the current environment.

## Why should I use this?

The `setConfig` function is useful for setting up the Doc Detective tool and ensuring that it is configured correctly. It can be used to set environment variables, load environment variables for the configuration, validate the configuration object, standardize value formats, and detect the current environment.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `setConfig` function, you must have the Doc Detective tool installed and have a configuration object that you want to use.

## How to use this

To use the `setConfig` function, simply pass the configuration object that you want to use as the input parameter. The function will then validate the configuration object, standardize the value formats, and detect the current environment.

Here is an example of how to use the `setConfig` function:

```javascript
const config = {
  envVariables: {
    // Environment variables to set
  },
  input: [
    // Input files or directories
  ],
  runTests: {
    input: [
      // Input files or directories for tests
    ],
    setup: [
      // Setup commands for tests
    ],
    cleanup: [
      // Cleanup commands for tests
    ],
  },
};

const updatedConfig = await setConfig(config);
```

The `updatedConfig` object will contain the configuration object that was passed in, with any necessary modifications made.

## Additional notes

* The `setConfig` function can also be used to set environment variables for the Doc Detective tool. To do this, simply pass an object containing the environment variables that you want to set as the `envVariables` property of the configuration object.
* The `setConfig` function will automatically detect the current environment. However, you can also specify the environment explicitly by setting the `environment` property of the configuration object.
* The `setConfig` function will return a Promise that resolves to the updated configuration object.
