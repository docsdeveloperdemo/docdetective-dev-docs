## What does this do?

The `setFiles` function is used to set the files that will be used for testing. It takes a configuration object as an argument and returns an array of files.

## Why should I use this?

The `setFiles` function is useful for setting up a test environment. It can be used to specify which files should be included in the test run, and which files should be excluded.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `setFiles` function, you must have a configuration object that specifies the files that you want to include in the test run.

## How to use this

To use the `setFiles` function, you must pass a configuration object as an argument. The configuration object must contain the following properties:

* `runTests.setup`: An array of files that should be run before the test run.
* `runTests.input`: An array of files that should be included in the test run.
* `runTests.cleanup`: An array of files that should be run after the test run.

The `setFiles` function will then return an array of files that will be used for testing.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `setFiles` function:

```javascript
const config = {
  runTests: {
    setup: ['setup.js'],
    input: ['input.js'],
    cleanup: ['cleanup.js'],
  },
};

const files = setFiles(config);

console.log(files);
```

The output of the above example will be an array of files that will be used for testing.
