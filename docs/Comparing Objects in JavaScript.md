## What does this do?

The `object` parameter is compared to the `matchObject` parameter to determine if they are equal. The comparison is based on the following criteria:

* The line numbers of the two objects must be equal.
* The text of the two objects must be equal.
* The index of the two objects in the file must be equal.

If all three of these criteria are met, then the two objects are considered to be equal.

## Why should I use this?

This code can be used to compare two objects to see if they are equal. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as:

* Testing the equality of two objects.
* Finding duplicate objects in a list.
* Merging two objects together.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using this code.

## How to use this

To use this code, simply pass two objects to the `compareObjects` function. The function will return a boolean value indicating whether or not the two objects are equal.

Here is an example of how to use this code:

```javascript
const object1 = {
  line: 1,
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  indexInFile: 0
};

const object2 = {
  line: 1,
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  indexInFile: 0
};

const areEqual = compareObjects(object1, object2);

console.log(areEqual); // true
```

## Conclusion

The `compareObjects` function is a simple and efficient way to compare two objects to see if they are equal. This code can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as testing the equality of two objects, finding duplicate objects in a list, and merging two objects together.
