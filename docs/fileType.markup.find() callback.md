## What does this do?

The `markConfig` variable is used to find the markup configuration for a given markup name. This configuration is used to determine how the markup should be rendered.

## Why should I use this?

The `markConfig` variable can be used to customize the way that markup is rendered. This can be useful for creating custom themes or for changing the way that markup is displayed in different contexts.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for using the `markConfig` variable.

## How to use this

To use the `markConfig` variable, you first need to find the markup configuration for the markup name that you want to use. This can be done by calling the `markup.find()` method on the `fileType.markup` array. Once you have found the markup configuration, you can use it to customize the way that the markup is rendered.

For example, the following code shows how to use the `markConfig` variable to change the color of the text that is rendered for a given markup name:

```
const markConfig = fileType.markup.find((markup) => markup.name === 'bold');
markConfig.style = 'color: red;';
```

This code will change the color of the text that is rendered for the `bold` markup name to red.

## Conclusion

The `markConfig` variable can be used to customize the way that markup is rendered. This can be useful for creating custom themes or for changing the way that markup is displayed in different contexts.
