## What does this do?

The `buildSetVariables` function is used to set environment variables before running a command. It prompts the user to choose whether they want to load environment variables and, if so, provides a path to the `.env` file.

## Why should I use this?

Using this function can be helpful if you need to set environment variables before running a command. This can be useful for setting up development environments or for running commands that require specific environment variables to be set.

## Prerequisites

Before using this function, you will need to have a `.env` file that contains the environment variables that you want to set.

## How to use this

To use this function, you can call it with the following parameters:

* `config`: The configuration object for the command.
* `match`: The match object for the command.

The function will then prompt the user to choose whether they want to load environment variables. If the user chooses to load environment variables, the function will read the `.env` file and set the environment variables accordingly.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `buildSetVariables` function:

```
const config = {
  env: '.env',
};

const match = {
  command: 'run',
};

buildSetVariables(config, match);
```

This example will prompt the user to choose whether they want to load environment variables. If the user chooses to load environment variables, the function will read the `.env` file located at the path specified in the `config` object and set the environment variables accordingly.
