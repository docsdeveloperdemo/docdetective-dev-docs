## What does this do?

The `checkMarkupCoverage` function analyzes the coverage of markup (e.g., comments, tags, etc.) in a set of files. It identifies which markup elements are covered by tests and which are not.

## Why should I use this?

This function can be used to ensure that the documentation for a codebase is complete and accurate. By identifying which markup elements are not covered by tests, developers can prioritize writing tests for those elements. This can help to improve the overall quality of the documentation and make it more useful for developers.

## Prerequisites

To use the `checkMarkupCoverage` function, you will need to have the following:

* A set of files to analyze.
* A test coverage report for the files.
* A list of markup elements to check for.

## How to use this

To use the `checkMarkupCoverage` function, follow these steps:

1. Import the `checkMarkupCoverage` function into your code.
2. Call the `checkMarkupCoverage` function with the following arguments:
    * The set of files to analyze.
    * The test coverage report for the files.
    * The list of markup elements to check for.
3. The function will return a coverage report that identifies which markup elements are covered by tests and which are not.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `checkMarkupCoverage` function to analyze the coverage of markup in a set of files:

```javascript
const checkMarkupCoverage = require('./check-markup-coverage');

// Get the set of files to analyze.
const files = ['file1.js', 'file2.js', 'file3.js'];

// Get the test coverage report for the files.
const testCoverage = {
  files: [
    {
      file: 'file1.js',
      coveredLines: [1, 2, 3],
      uncoveredLines: [4, 5, 6],
      fileType: {
        markup: [
          {
            name: 'comment',
            regex: ['//.*'],
          },
          {
            name: 'tag',
            regex: ['@.*'],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
    {
      file: 'file2.js',
      coveredLines: [1, 2, 3],
      uncoveredLines: [4, 5, 6],
      fileType: {
        markup: [
          {
            name: 'comment',
            regex: ['//.*'],
          },
          {
            name: 'tag',
            regex: ['@.*'],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
    {
      file: 'file3.js',
      coveredLines: [1, 2, 3],
      uncoveredLines: [4, 5, 6],
      fileType: {
        markup: [
          {
            name: 'comment',
            regex: ['//.*'],
          },
          {
            name: 'tag',
            regex: ['@.*'],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
};

// Get the list of markup elements to check for.
const markupElements = ['comment', 'tag'];

// Call the checkMarkupCoverage function.
const coverageReport = checkMarkupCoverage(files, testCoverage, markupElements);

// Print the coverage report.
console.log(coverageReport);
```

The output of the `checkMarkupCoverage` function will be a coverage report that identifies which markup elements are covered by tests and which are not. This information can be used to improve the documentation for a codebase and make it more useful for developers.
